'Awareness program for public on preventing motorcycle accidents','Health Ministry officials will commence an awareness program to educate the public on preventing motorcycle accidents, Health Minister Maithripala Sirisena said. Addressing a workshop on vertebra injuries rehabilitation in Colombo recently, the minister said the most common accident in Sri Lanka is motorcycle accidents. \"The public needs to be educated on this,\" Minister Sirisena said. According to Minister Sirisena, educating the public on preventing accidents and handling accident victims the proper way, help save lives of accident victims with vertebra injuries which needs special care to prevent further injuries when transporting them to hospital. Minister Sirisena presented a special award to Priyantha Peiris who dedicated his life to serve patients with vertebra injuries. Peiris was injured when he jumped from a 50 feet building to escape a fire at his hostel in Lumumba University, Russia in 1995. ',No
'LANKA’s Oxford prof. without a degree','Two of today’s items may have only tenuous connections with Madras, but I’m writing about them as they do have intriguing links with the city. My first tale is about a person whose linguistic bonds should make him known at least to the world of Tamil Studies, but I wonder how many in that world here recognise the name of Don Martino De Zilva Wickremasinghe (1865-1937). Certainly, despite all my years in Ceylon and my peripheral contact there with education, archaeology and epigraphy — that an all-round journalist and a dabbler in history must have — I had never heard of him till another history hobbyist, Thiru Arumugam, sent me some material the other day from Australia. After his high school education, Wickremasinghe joined the Colombo Museum Library, was later transferred to the Archaeological Survey of Ceylon, from where he was sent on scholarship to Germany. The focus of his work till then had been Sinhalese, Pali and Prakrit. And it was no doubt for this that the British Museum Library recruited him to do cataloguing of books and manuscripts in these languages. We next find him being appointed in 1899 as the Epigraphist of the Government of Ceylon and working on the Epigraphia Zeylanica at the Indian Institute at Oxford University. Which record would not really interest readers of this column. But now comes the twist in the tale. \r\nTiruvadi Sambasiva Venkatraman In 1909 Wickremasinghe was appointed first, Lecturer, then Reader, in Tamil and Telugu at Jesus College, Oxford! He was also an External Examiner for other British Universities in Sinhalese, Pali and Sanskrit. And all this without a university degree! As though there was no degreed native speaker in Tamil or Telugu with expertise in Sanskrit in India! It is, however, stated that he was a fluent speaker in English, German, Sinhalese, Pali and Prakrit — all understandable achievements in the background of what has been said before — but also in Tamil, Telugu and Malayalam. So fluent that he lectured in all of them — and, to emphasise the point, the ‘all’ included the last three languages listed! Now where did he learn them — and at a level to be so highly rated? That’s a mystery that I hope to get an answer to some day. To set this unique academic record straight, Oxford awarded him an honorary Master’s degree. And before you knew it, in 1916 he was being described as ‘Lecturer in Tamil and Telugu in the University of Oxford, and in Pali and Prakrit for Jesus College, Oxford’. Later the same year, he was being referred to as the ‘Epigraphist Lecturer in South Indian Languages in the London School of Oriental Studies’. And in 1928, he was described as ‘Reader in Tamil and Telugu in the University of London, Lecturer in Sinhalese, and Head of the Dravidian Department of the London School of Oriental Studies’. Somewhere midst all this he was the Professor of Sanskrit in the University of Edinburgh, all this with only that belated honorary degree from Oxford University! During these years, apart from scholarly titles on epigraphy, Wickremasinghe came out with a series of popular books published in London by E. Marlborough & Co: Tamil Grammar Self-Taught and Tamil Self-Taught in 1906, and Sinhalese Self-Taught and Malayalam Self-Taught in 1916. Why he did not do Telugu Self-Taught or why it did not come out if he had indeed done it is another of the mysteries in Wickremasinghe’s life. Perhaps some of the answers to all this would be with an old friend of JNU and Madras University, Prof. Sudharshan Seneviratne, who is the new High Commissioner for Sri Lanka in New Delhi and who had held the only Chair in Archaeology in any university in Ceylon. He had done his Ph.D. at JNU, his thesis being ‘Social Base of Early Buddhism in Southeast India (Andhra and Tamil Nadu) and Sri Lanka, 3rd Century B.C. to 3rd Century A.D.’ His guides for this work were S. Gopal, R. Champalakshmi and K. Meenakshi, all from Madras, and much of his research was done in the Theosophical Society Library. During his 10 years in India, Hindi, Tamil and Telugu were all languages he could communicate in. When he was in Madras in 2003 to deliver a couple of lectures, at the one at the University of Madras Prof. Seneviratne invited its Department of Archaeology to forge links with his Department at the University of Peradeniya, Sri Lanka’s premier university, and work on digs that had been allotted to it. But nothing came of it. Sadly. He fostered Indian cricket The other link with Madras I recently found was in a news item that caught my eye for two other reasons: One, it had to do with heritage, a heritage mansion being allowed to crumble in Bombay, and, two, that building being where Lord Harris had lived when he was Governor of Bombay, 1890-95. Lord Harris, it could be said with considerable justice, was the person responsible for first class cricket getting its beginnings in India and for, later, sending out the first team from England to play India in ‘Tests’, unofficial though they were. Though Harris had a fairly impressive cricket record in his youth, and yearned to play the game in India, he was also a stickler for protocol. So he never played in Bombay, but did so every time he took a ‘holiday’ at Ganeshind near Poona. And there he encouraged an annual fixture between teams led by the Governors of Bombay and Madras. Of this series he later wrote in his biography: “During a part of my five years in India, my old school fellow, Lord Wenlock, who had been a Wet Bob at Eton but was always quite a good cricketer, was Governor of Madras (1891-96), and we arranged a visit one year of the Madras Eleven to Poona, another of the Poona Eleven to Madras. Poor Wenlock had a very serious accident while playing Cricket one day. The ball hit him in the mouth, driving his teeth through his lips. In writing him a letter of sympathy, I could not help adding that I should advise him in future not to put his head where his bat ought to be.” Harris, a bit of a martinet and a stickler for the rules also had a sense of humour. He also, as I said earlier, had a notable cricket record. He won his Blue at Oxford, captained Kent — which county contributed significantly to Madras cricket — for 15 continuous seasons, and led England against Australia in four ‘Test’ matches between 1878 and 1884. He became the President of the Marylebone Cricket Club that virtually governed world cricket at the time, and, while also heading the Imperial Cricket Conference, got England to send out A.E.R. Gilligan’s team to tour India (1926-27). It was just after this that plans were drawn up to form an organisation to run Indian cricket. Many years earlier, in 1892, Harris sowed the seeds for first class cricket in India by mooting a match, Bombay Presidency Europeans vs. the Parsis, that was to lead to the Pentangular. And he offered the Harris Shield for school cricket in Bombay — and the still ongoing competition for the shield is where the world first heard of Tendulkar and Kambli. To see Bombay of all places, once the leader of the urban heritage movement in India, let a place that should be a memorial to the birth of Indian cricket languish and slowly crumble, is unbelievable. But there it is. Perhaps the BCCI will do something to resurrect it as a memorial. Why not as its office? Making sugar a success Today, India is the world’s second largest producer of sugar but success appears to bring with it its own problems. Almost daily for some months now the dispute over the pricing of sugarcane has hogged the headlines. This attention being paid to sugar would not be possible but for a scarcely remembered man, Tiruvadi Sambasiva Venkatraman (TSV), virtually forgotten by all, even those making the loudest noises about the price of cane. But in his day his work won him numerous honours, including a knighthood. \r\nHigh Commissioner for\r\n \t\t\tSri Lanka in New Delhi\r\n \t\t\tProf. Sudharshan Seneviratne To meet the Empire’s demand for sugar, the British established in Coimbatore in 1912 the Imperial Sugarcane Station. Charles Barber, a South African botanist, was appointed its first superintendent. He took as his deputy TSV, who had joined the Indian Agricultural Service after getting a postgraduate degree from the University of Madras. At the breeding station, now called the Sugarcane Breeding Institute, TSV got down to hybridisation in what was described as “the first attempt to improve the subtropical types of canes”. What he developed was sugarcane that yielded 35 times more sucrose than what the natural stock yielded! Of this achievement it has been said that “the development of high-yielding cane varieties in India was a breakthrough which matches the development of high-yielding varieties of wheat in Mexico by the Nobel Laureate Norman Borlaug”. The first variety released by the Station in 1918, Co 205, is said to have recorded more than “50 per cent improvement in cane yield over the native varieties and replaced them within a short span of six to eight years, marking the green revolution in sugarcane”. The thirty years TSV spent on ever improving the yield of sugarcane in India was a rare commitment to research that began as a response to renowned educationist Pandit Madan Mohan Malviya’s call to “undertake research to increase production of sugar, making it available especially for the malnourished children”. The only work of substance on TSV’s contribution has been a biography by J. Thulajaram Rao, TSV’s student and a Director of the Sugarcane Breeding Institute in the 1960s and 1970s.

'President to open renovated Badulla–Mahiyangana road','The reconstructed and renovated Badulla-Mahiyangana main road will be commissioned by President Mahinda Rajapaksa at Mahiyangana junction at 3.00 p.m. today. Fulfilling a long felt need of the motorists and residents of the area. The road has been rebuilt at a cost of Rs. 6,720 million, Highways, Ports and Shipping Project Minister Nirmala Kothalawala told the Daily News yesterday. He said the length of the road is 35.5km which has been renovated using local funds. The width of the road is 8.2 meters. Kothalawala said the road was developed on the instructions of President Mahinda Rajapaksa for the convenience of the people in the Uva Province under the Mahinda Chintana accelerated road development program. When developing the Badulla-Mahiyangana main road, the safety and the environmental issues were specifically given consideration. “Actually we worked with the Central Environment Authority and followed their guidelines. In every project we have an environmental management plan. We act based on that,” Kothalawala said. “With regard to landslides we are also working with the National Building Research Organization. We got their advice,” he said. The road has been carpeted and widened to ease the traffic congestion while reducing the dangerous nature of the road due to the narrowness and precipitous surroundings. The project minister said the President has instructed the officials to renovate the road without causing any damage to the historic value and natural beauty of the Badulla-Mahiyanganaya road which has a history of over 2,500 years. Bridges and box culverts too have been reconstructed along the road. Meanwhile, the roadway has been widened to prevent road accidents and made suitable for local weather and geographical conditions. Parallel to the Badulla-Maniyangana main road renovation project, internal road network and vehicle parks in three main towns in Mahiyangana, Meegahakula and Badulla have also been developed. ',No
'With love, from the bookworms','There’s a quote by Henry Ward Beecher saying, “Where is human nature so weak as in the bookstore?’’. If you are a bookworm, a booklover I need not explain that quickened heart beat, the rush of excitement against your skin at the crisp fresh aroma from the newly turned pages. You feel elated,dreamy, ecstatic even! We, the book lovers, await September with bundled hope and stashed pocket money and portions of wages that we saved to spend quite eagerly to expand our homemade libraries. The Colombo International Book Fair is therefore one of the most awaited events of the year! People, booklovers, exhibition lovers and simply even maggi noodles lovers arrive at the BMICH from all over the country, to feast their eyes on books, to take home as much books as they could carry or if not, to feast their eyes on those who come for the book fair. After visiting the book fair during two days of the last week, and after talking to several of the people I met at the premises, I was able to come up with a few points which reflected the book fair as booklovers expected it to be. It should last longer Being perhaps the only opportunity for the Sri Lankan booklovers to be enthralled and surprised by the thrills of literature, the BMICH is of course bound to be crowded from the day it begins! To the day it ends! Making it next to impossible to enter a book store let alone go through the shelves to search for a favourite book! And several booklovers said that perhaps they spent more time waiting in the queue at the cashier than they spent on the actual selection of book! Due to overcrowding it is quite inconvenient for most as they have to survive trampled toes, not to mention “unintentional’’ groping by certain ‘booklovers’ who tend to perhaps take advantage of the situation. If the book fair was extended to perhaps two weeks or even one and a half weeks, perhaps this might at least be controlled to a certain extent. Should host book readings and engaging discussions Being the sole opportunity for the Sri Lankan bookworms to taste the World of Literature, one should be able to be satisfied and feel more engaged in the exhibition according to several people I talked to. They specifically said that the book fair needs room for discussions and readings, and for fellow booklovers to interact and share their common interests. Accordingly, the book fair should not be a mere exchange of money for books, it should be something that could grow the reader community and widen a reader’s perspective. Broaden the opportunities of choice According to many booklovers the CIBF 2014 did not have many books to choose from expect the recent award winning and best selling novels commonly accepted as ‘good books’.  The selection of books available appeared to be more of the seller’s choice than the buyer’s choice. Priority was given to novels in comparison to other forms of literature. Poetry, short stories, translations too were not given the due recognition. And in a group I encountered in a certain social media an author has written a heart warming entry saying ‘’ The Book fair was monopolized by the large scale publishers, giving us authors who publish with small scale publishers zero to none recognition”. Further, several people said that ‘‘The Book Fair this time around did not seem to be properly planned, yet seemed to be arranged all of a sudden, perhaps out of obligation” Encouraging a range of discounts Many of those who visited the Book Fair wished that Books were available at a range of discounted rates. Of course don’t we Bookworms always love bargained prices and discounts when it comes to books! Yet it was observed that most die hard bookworms did not visit the Book Fair due to the lack of selection, and the ability to buy books at better discount rates from their stores itself. Though there seems to be a great room for improvement to the Bookfair from the organizer’s side according to those who frequented the premises, Let me break down the five types of people you might have come across at the CIBF 2014. 1. Die-hard Book worms You could see them crawling on the floor in between book shelves to go through the books in the bottom most shelf. They stand here and there mezmerised and staring at certain books, unaware of the world, unaware of the people trying to cut past them to access the next book. You could see them quite selflessly exchanging crisp notes of thousands and two thousands for bags of books, their eyes lit up, as if they just bought happiness. 2. Those who think being a Book Worm is a trend. In several stores I observed those dressed in ridiculously flashy and attractive outfits just to go through several thousand books seeming to be looking for a certain book, yet after hours of roaming around the Book Fair decide to spend money on some maggi noodles instead. The devilled noodles seemed to cater their literary needs more than the books did. 3. Lovebirds and friends The book fair does not bring only booklovers and books together. It is a common meet up place, a get together venue for long lost friends and clandestine lovers. You could see them feeding each other maggi noodles and sipping minute maid behind the lush bushes in the BMICH premises. Certain couples searching for books together was a common sight which we found quite romantic. Many friends have made it an opportunity to spend a day together! What more could you ask for than a few thousand books and loved once around you! 4. Sightseers Yes, there was that type who were there to entertain themselves watching others, stalking them even and ‘accidentally’ bumping into girls and women who were too engrossed in books. These sightseers were loitering the premises low ‘cat calling’ and trying to gain some attention and feasting their eyes on those who were feasting their eyes on books. For them the Book Fair was just another carnival catering to their entertainment and sightseeing needs. The Book Fair therefore is a joint effort of the public and the organizers, it has its own lessons to learn. Anna Quindlen once said that “Books are the plane, and the train and the road. They are the destination and the journey. They are my home”, Despite everything that the Book Fair is not, you cannot possibly feel anything less than happy when you forget the world, because books are indeed Home. Pictures by Siripala Halwala phusathi@yahoo.com Festival at a glance Phusathi Liyanaarachchi It is once again that time of the year that gives life to butterflies in a booklover’s stomach! The time of the year that one awaits to feast their minds and eyes upon thousands of books and inhale that heart quickening scent of new crisp pages!!! The book fair that was initiated in 1999 with only 28 stalls, has developed over the last fifteen years into a massive world class exhibition consisting of about 400 local stalls and 50 foreign stalls inclusive of India, China, Japan, Malaysia, Singapore and Saudi Arabia that will cater to a multitude of literary needs of the public. Introducing a new dimension to the book fair and new opportunities to the visitors who exceed one million each year, the organizers have decided to invite a certain guest country here on out. China graced the event this year with a special appearance, and opportunities were provided for those who are interested in translating Chinese literary texts to our mother tongue and our literary texts to Chinese.

'[ESSENCE - (16-09-2014)]','Man Gets 3D Printed Titanium Skull   The fall caused some drastic damage, but Hu looked hopeful before the surgery. The ability to design and print replacement body parts that are customized to an individual\'s needs is revolutionizing medicine.   This year alone, doctors have printed tubes that stabilized a child\'s collapsed windpipe and they\'ve installed the first ever 3D printed vertebra in a 12-year-old boy. Now, in a surgery that was one of the first of its kind, doctors replaced part of a Chinese man\'s skull with 3D printed titanium mesh that was molded to perfectly restore the part of his skull that had been smashed in an accident. In October of 2013 the man, a 46-year-old named Hu who lives in a town near Xi\'an, was working on a construction project when he fell. He plunged three stories and smashed his head on a pile of wood. The fall caved in a significant portion of his skull, damaging his brain, causing vision loss, especially in his left eye, and depriving him of most of his ability to write and speak. The surgery should help Hu rebuild the shape of his head, and may allow his brain to heal enough that he regains the ability to speak. Doctors at Xijing Hospital in Xi\'an brought in experts from around the world to try and figure out how to restore some sense of normalcy for Hu. They decided to scan Hu\'s head and 3D print a titanium mesh replacement for part of his cranium, modeled after the right side of his head in order to give him a symmetrical appearance. Even more impressive, his doctors think that after his brain has time to repair itself and grow within its new titanium structure, Hu should regain some of his lost ability to communicate. Local news reports showed him smiling and excited before the surgery. With printing materials specially made in Belgium and provided by Stryker, an American medical device manufacturer, Hu underwent surgery on the morning of August 28. After, he was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit to recover. Titanium is a common replacement material for bones since it usually doesn\'t cause any adverse reaction - US Rep. Gabby Giffords had part of her skull patched with titanium mesh after being shot in the head in 2011 - but they still have to ensure that Hu\'s system doesn\'t reject the transplant. His doctors, however, believe the transplant will be successful. While this is one of the first transplants of its kind, medical developments in 3D printing technology have been offering people the chance at a new life all over the world. The first ever complete 3D printed skull was implanted in a woman earlier in 2014. Without her new plastic cranium, a rare bone cancer would made her skull grow too thick and eventually would have killed her. The Food and Drug Administration approved implants for facial reconstruction in August, and researchers are looking into ways that 3D printers can replace veins, skin, and other organs too. As this technology continues to transform what doctors can do, more and more people suffering from grave injuries and diseases will have a previously unimaginable shot at a new life. And that\'s pretty amazing. Business Insider Sleepwalking Dangers: Man Falls Off 60-Foot Cliff A man\'s undiagnosed sleepwalking nearly turned life-threatening when he sleepwalked off a 60-foot cliff while camping. Twenty-seven-year-old Ryan Campbell was camping in Kentucky with friends when he fell asleep in a hammock, according to ABC News. But in the early morning, his friends saw him get up and sleepwalk off a cliff. Fortunately, a rhododendron bush broke his fall, and the man had no life-threatening injuries, ABC News reported. Although Campbell did not know that he was a sleepwalker, “most sleepwalkers know that they sleepwalk,” said Dr. Sheila Tsai, of the Division of Pulmonary, Critical Care and Sleep Medicine at National Jewish Health hospital in Denver. That\'s because family members or friends often tell sleepwalkers that they have the condition, or sleepwalkers sometimes discover clues around their house, such as leftover candy wrappers if they eat in the night, Tsai said. Sleepwalking is more common in children than in adults, and only about 4 percent of people who sleepwalk in childhood will continue to sleepwalk into adulthood, Tsai said. A 2012 study found that about 3.6 percent of US adults said they had sleepwalked in the last year. Certain things may trigger sleepwalking episodes, including stress, sleep deprivation, drug or alcohol use, and use of certain medications, such as antidepressants, Tsai said. Sleeping in a new and unfamiliar environment can also trigger sleepwalking, which would seem to fit with the man\'s case, Tsai said. So, should Campbell avoid camping from now on? Not necessarily, Tsai said. “The important thing is to emphasize safety,” Tsai said. “They need to make sure that their surroundings are safe.” This includes making sure other people know about the sleepwalking, and locking away things that could be dangerous to a sleepwalker, such as guns, hunting equipment or car keys (if a person drives while sleepwalking), Tsai said. Campbell said he will keep camping, but will be more cautious. “I don\'t care how rare it is that I sleepwalk; I\'m not sleeping by cliffs anymore,” he told ABC News. If sleepwalking is due to an underlying factor - such as sleep deprivation, medication or another sleep disorder - the sleepwalking may become less frequent or stop if this underlying factor is treated, Tsai said. Yahoo News Why Don’t Disney Princesses Have Mothers? One Theory Might Make You Sad: Disney princesses have something in common besides their happy endings and fairy tale weddings — most of them are motherless. Frozen sisters Anna and Elsa lost both of their parents, as did Snow White and Cinderella. Ariel, Jasmine, and Belle were all raised by their fathers. Non-princess character Bambi also lost his mother in one of the most heart-wrenching animated movie moments of all time. So why do so many Disney princesses and other Disney characters grow up without mothers? During a recent interview with Glamour, Maleficent producer Don Hahn has an interesting explanation for why mothers are so scarce in animated Disney movies. It has something to do with a tragic event that changed Walt Disney’s life forever. ““Walt Disney, in the early 1940s, when he was still living at this house, also bought a house for his mom and dad to move into. He had the studio guys come over and fix the furnace, but when his mom and dad moved in, the furnace leaked and his mother died. The housekeeper came in the next morning and pulled his mother and father out on the front lawn. His father was sick and went to the hospital, but his mother died.” According to Hahn, Disney felt partly responsible for the death of his mother - if he hadn’t bought his parents that house, his mother wouldn’t have died so soon. He also blamed himself because he sent the studio men who failed to properly repair the broken furnace. “It’s every kid’s dream to buy their parents a house and just through a strange freak of nature - through no fault of his own - the studio workers didn’t know what they were doing. There’s a theory, and I’m not a psychologist, but he was really haunted by that. That idea that he really contributed to his mom’s death was really tragic.” It would make sense for this tragedy to have a profound effect on Walt Disney’s future projects, but Hahn’s theory doesn’t actually explain why many of the Disney princesses became motherless. Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs was released before Walt Disney’s mother died in 1938, and The Little Mermaid, Beauty and the Beast, Aladdin, and Frozen were released long after Walt Disney’s death. The only movies with missing moms that his mother’s death would have had an effect on were Bambi and Cinderella. Sleeping Beauty was released while Walt was alive, but Princess Aurora is one of the few Disney princesses who gets to keep both of her parents. Hahn offered a second explanation for the large number of motherless Disney princesses that makes a little more sense. “One reason is practical because the movies are 80 or 90 minutes long, and Disney films are about growing up. They’re about that day in your life when you have to accept responsibility. Simba ran away from home but had to come back. In shorthand, it’s much quicker to have characters grow up when you bump off their parents. Bambi’s mother gets killed, so he has to grow up. Belle only has a father, but he gets lost, so she has to step into that position. It’s a story shorthand.” As Hahn pointed out by using The Lion King as example, some Disney characters also lose their fathers but keep their mothers. Princess Tiana from The Princess and the Frog is another example of a character whose father is killed off. While Walt Disney’s family tragedy might not be the reason so many Disney princesses lose a parent or two, it’s interesting that the deceased parent trope has survived in Disney movies for so long. As The Inquisitr previously reported, the orphaned sisters from Disney’s Frozen have become so popular that they’re going to appear in live-action form on ABC’s Once Upon a Time. According to People, the newest Disney princesses are also getting their own ride at Walt Disney World Resort. Because of the mega success of Frozen and the continued love for the other motherless Disney Princesses, expect to see the House of Mouse murdering moms for many years to come. Inquisitr Kanye West Stops Concert to Yell At Wheelchair-Bound Kid, ‘Stand Up!’ At a concert on Friday in Sydney, Australia, the acclaimed rapper called out a pair of fans for not standing up at the show. One had a prosthetic limb, and the other was in a wheelchair. Oh, Kanye. The acclaimed rapper/self-described Steve Jobs/newly minted Kardashian, who once rapped, “They tryna put me on the schoolbus with the space for the wheelchair,” halted a concert on Friday night after discovering that several audience members weren’t standing up to honor their lord and savior. The setting was the Qantas Credit Union Arena in Sydney, Australia, and West reportedly announced, “I can’t do this song. I can’t do this show until everybody stand up… Unless you got a handicap pass and you get special parking and shit. ‘Imma see you if you ain’t standing up, believe me, I’m very good at that.” Then came the foot-in-mouth moment. Most of the fans got up and boogied, but then West spotted a pair who’d remained in their seats, and refused to continue the show until the stood up and danced like the rest. One of the fans raised a prosthetic limb, thereby proving that she did “get special parking and shit,” to which West replied, “Okay, you fine.” West then homed in on Fan No. 2, who was still seated. He stopped performing the tune “The Good Life” and declared, “This is the longest I’ve had to wait to do a song, it’s unbelievable.” The crowd was reportedly trying to clue in Kanye to his epic blunder, with the entire section making wheelchair signals with their arms. But to no avail. West sent his bulky bodyguard Pascal Duvier into the crowd to confirm that the seated fan was, in fact, in a wheelchair. When it was confirmed, West said, “He is in a wheelchair? It’s fine!” Many fans tweeted their disapproval: Now in the interest of fairness, West has treated handicapped fans well in the past. At a past concert, he even gave his microphone to a wheelchair-bound audience member.

'Chinese boy who received Lankan eyes in emotional meeting with donor family','People to people contact is perhaps the best way to build relations between countries and this was emphasised when a Chinese boy who had received an eye cornea from a Sri Lankan, met the family in an emotional exchange on Friday. In April 2011, Saman Amerasena died in an accident when he slipped and fell in his home. The family rushed him to hospital but was informed by doctors he would not recover. He was only 47 years. “I was devastated. In Sri Lanka it is common to donate organs once a person is dead but we had not signed up for any such program. However, the doctors at the hospital encouraged me to donate my husband’s eyes and so I agreed,” said his wife Sandya Amarasena. In doing so she gave sight to a six-year-old Chinese boy, Xu Pengfei who damaged an eye while playing at school. Three years later, he arrived in Sri Lanka to personally thank the family. Sri Lanka is among the largest cornea providers in the world. The cultural background of the country has helped eye donation thrive. The Buddhist concept of Dana or giving, has been the root cause of its success, in a country whose population is 75 percent Buddhist. Hindus and Christians have also donated eyes under the cultural concept of giving. In fact, the island of 20 million people is home to the first organisation in the world that supplies or transplants corneas free of charge to the public. Since its establishment in 1958, thousands of Sri Lankans have donated eyes that have been distributed to over 57 countries. Sri Lanka also has a National Eye and Tissue Bank, which is one of the largest in the world where corneas are kept in storage before being shipped around the globe. Over the last few years, around 1,500 corneas has been flown to China for transplant, helping strengthen ties between the two countries in the process. “I felt like my husband was looking at me when this boy walked into the house,” said an emotional Sandya Amarasena. To mark the occasion, both she and her two daughters signed a document pledging to donate their eyes upon their deaths. It is estimated that over a million people in Sri Lanka have made similar pledges to provide eyes to the world. Courtesy: Xinhua ',Yes
'China, Lanka to ink over 20 agreements','China will sign more than 20 agreements with Sri Lanka during President Xi Jingping\'s visit to Sri Lanka on September 16. Chinese Ambassador in Colombo Wu Jianhao said the two governments will ink agreements forging closer cooperation in the political, economic, cultural and social arenas during the visit. He said the finalised agreement over the construction of the Colombo Port city will be signed by the two sides. China Harbour Company Limited is investing over US$ 1.4 billion for this project under the first phase. Over 276 hecatres will be reclaimed from the sea by the Chinese company and one third of this land is developed by the Chinese company. Speaking at a press briefing at the embassy in Colombo yesterday, the Ambassador said the total investment for the second phase of the project will be US$ 13 billion. The Chinese Ambassador added that the Chinese company will attract investors from China and all over the world to develop this extent of land. He said two third of this reclaimed land will be left for the Sri Lankan government to develop attracting investors locally and overseas. The Chinese envoy said the Ceylon Electricity Board and China Machinery Engineering Corporation will sign two agreements for the cooperation and transfer of technology over the maintenance and operation of coal power plant. \"China will send more engineers to Sri Lanka to train their Sri Lankan counterparts on the operation of the coal power plant,\" he said. He said the two companies has had very close cooperation though technology transfer takes some time. The Ambassador said the problems arose at the coal power plant due to a communication gap between the Sri Lankan and Chinese engineers and accidents. The envoy also said engineers were regularly trained over the operation and maintenance of the power plant. He said Sri Lankan engineers refused to sit the examination which has to be passed at the conclusion of the training. The Chinese envoy added that this is the first visit by a President of China after a lapse of 28 years. \"This visit is historic and will chart the course and build a solid platform for the development of bilateral ties,\" he said. He said China and Sri Lanka relations have improved rapidly and China has become Sri Lanka\'s second largest trading partner and second largest source of imports. ',No
'[Legal Aid Commission] 13.09.2014','Looking after persons with disabilities All human beings are born free, equal in dignity and rights. The recognition of “dignity and justice for all persons” is a universal principle. The Charter of the United Nations states, “We the people of the United Nations reaffirm faith in fundamental human rights, in the dignity and worth of the human person, in the equal rights of men and women. Therefore it is the responsibility of all countries to safeguard and ensure the rights of every persons. Any sort of discrimination, communication and physical access to justice should be prevented. All citizens should have access to justice irrespective of their poverty, caste, creed, religion, gender or political views. As such all persons should be treated equally before the law. This emphasizes the fundamental human rights of the human person and protects the Persons with Disabilities too. The United Nations and World Health Organization (WHO) estimated that about 15\% of the world\'s population lives with some form of disability, of whom 2-4\% experience significant difficulties in functioning.The population of Sri Lanka is just over 20 million. This category of persons with disabilities represents 5.4\% of the population of Sri Lanka. Persons with disabilities have the right to recognition everywhere as persons before the law and they should be recognized without any discrimination and they should be able to enjoy legal capacity on an equal basis with others in all aspects of life. United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities defines a disable as follows: “Persons with disabilities include those who have long-term physical, mental, intellectual or sensory impairments which in interaction with various barriers may hinder their full and effective participation in society on an equal basis with others”. The Interpretation section of the Act, No 28 of 1996 the Protection of the Rights of Persons with Disabilities defines a Person with disability as follows: “Any person who, as a result of any deficiency in his physical or mental capabilities, whether congenital or not, is unable by himself to ensure for himself, wholly or partly, the necessities of life”. In the local perspective, it is worth mentioning that the President’s 10 Year Plan – Mahinda Chinthana substituted the word Persons with Disabilities by “Differently able”. However, there are many synonymous terms for “Persons with Disabilities” in usage. ‘Justice’ means that the ability of people to seek and obtain a remedy through formal or informal institutions of justice, and in conformity with human rights standards. Access to Justice Means that the provision of remedies that people need in order to protect themselves from possible harm caused by others when involved in disputes or conflicts of interests. The three dimensions used to determine the access to justice are – The Convenience - (e.g. the ease in physically reaching the starting point of service),\r\n The Availability - (i.e. geographical proximity and accessibility of service) and\r\n The Affordability - (i.e. judicial services do not involve prohibitive costs). Women with disabilities experience double discrimination as women and as persons with disabilities. Children with disabilities in poor developing countries often have little to no access to health care. Persons with disabilities most of the time used as \"objects\"of charity, medical treatment and social protection; rather as \"subjects\" with rights, they have to be able to claiming those rights and making decisions for their lives based on their free and informed consent as well as being active members of society. Therefore it’s a challenge to address the future risk of disability. During the life time a person has to face some form of disability. The old age, infectious diseases currently produce few fears in almost all developing countries, but certain other disease conditions, particularly among elderly groups, have shown a dramatic increase. Disease or disorder may lead to impairment and then to disability. Disability is a life contingency occurring in human populations, which has economic, social and demographic implications. In social terms physical disablement imposes a moral responsibility on the society as a whole, with regard to the maintenance and welfare of the disabled elderly. Kalani A.

'MUTTIAH THEIVENDRA WAS AMAZING','Jaffna has produced some outstanding sportsmen and sportswomen who could have held their own against any opposition local or abroad. Not only did they excel in sport but were also brilliant with the books. To name them would require reams. One who towered in sports and studies and who I had the good fortune of meeting when on tour with the Sri Lanka cricketers in England and reminiscing about the exciting old times was Muttiah Theivendra, a cricketer, football and athlete and now having a lucrative practice as a General Practioner in Enfield. After passing out as a doctor from the Peradeniya University, he did his internship at the Jaffna hospital and then served as Medical Officer of Heath in Hettipola, Kurunegala and also served as Senior House Officer Orthopaedic and Trauma in accident and emergency before making England his home in 1981. Although figuring in three sports, It was in cricket and athletics that he shone like a star at St.John\'s College, Jaffna. He played for Sri Lanka Schools against the University team that emerged Sara Trophy champions in 1963. He was a leftie in cricket. Muttiah was an all rounder at cricket. He had the honour of captaining the Jaffna Schools against the Indian Schools in 1964. He also excelled playing for the University in 1974 and scoring 500 runs and having 50 victims in Sara Trophy cricket and was second to former Sri Lanka Captain and Chairman of Sri Lanka Cricket Interim Committee D.Somachandra de Silva. His best bowling effort and which he still talks about is the 9 wickets he captured against my old club Saracens in a Sara game in 1974. Muttiah also played for the Health Department in 1977 and also played Sara cricket for another old club of mine Tamil Union in 1978 and represented Silly Mid Offs in \'Daily News\' cricket. Muttiah who settled down in England in 1981 continued with his pet sport and played cricket in Wales and London. He married Meera Arulampalam in 1978 and his two sons are both doctors.

'Afghan forces wipe-out Taliban in northern district','AFGHANISTAN: Units of police backed by the army have rooted out militants in Chardara district in Afghanistan’s northern Kunduz province after a month-long clean up operations, provincial police chief Ghulam Mustafa Mohsini said Wednesday. “Chardara district has been cleaned of insurgents and normalcy has returned there after the troops killed 211 rebels during the month-long operation,” Mohsini told reporters. Chardara and adjoining districts of Imam Sahib, Dasht-e-Archi and Khanabad have been the scene of heavy fighting between the government forces and Taliban militants over the past one month during which hundreds of families left their homes for safer places. The provincial police chief also said that the displaced people can return to their homes free of any security concerns, Xinhua reported. However, he avoided commenting on the casualties among security personnel during the operations. The police also announced the end of operations in Chardara district. Meanwhile, a day earlier, an army commander in Kunduz, Gen. Jan Allah Safi, in talks with reporters in Chardara district said that “24 security personnel had been killed and injured” during the month-long crackdown on the armed militants. - DECCAN HERALD ',No
'Spell of Narcissism and Anatta doctrine','“Narcissism is a passion the intensity of which in many individuals can only be compared with sexual desire and the desire to stay alive. In fact, many times it proves to be stronger than either. Even in the average individual in whom it does not reach such intensity, there remains a narcissistic core which appears to be almost indestructible.” - Erich Fromm, The Heart of Man The word “narcissism” is derived from a Greek legend. Narcissus in mythology is a beautiful youth who loved no one till he saw his own body reflected in water. Narcissus fell in love with his own reflection; finally he pined away, died, and was turned into the flower of like name. Thus the word “narcissism” derived from this legend has been generally used to refer to a kind of morbid self-love. The concept of narcissism was woven into psychological theory by Sigmund Freud. Freud himself borrowed this name from Paul Nacke, who used the term to describe a perversion, where “an adult individual lavishes upon his own body all the caresses expended only upon a sexual object other than himself.” it was Freud, however, who grasped for the first time the tremendous significance of the concept of narcissism. Freud\'s essay on narcissism is one of the richest spots in his psychology, unfortunately neglected by his fellow psychiatrists and submerged by the popular image of Freud\'s work. Freud\'s essay on narcissism is a little gem which would have been pushed into an insignificant corner in the field of psychological theory, but for the efforts of Eric Fromm who remarks that, “One of the most fruitful and far-reaching of Freud\'s discoveries is his concept of narcissism. Freud himself considered it to be one of his most important findings...” In this paper I shall very briefly refer to the Freudian concept of narcissism and then present Fromm\'s development on this against the background of the anattaa doctrine. Ego instincts Before his paper on narcissism appeared, Freud made a clear distinction between the sexual instinct (libido) and the ego instinct, or in more popular terms between “love” and “hunger.” But he came across an interesting category of patients whose condition presented a great challenge to this distinction between sexual and ego instincts. “We became slowly accustomed to the conception that the libido, which we find attached to certain objects and which is the desire to gain some satisfaction in these objects, can also abandon these objects and set the ego itself in their place,” says Freud. More reflection on this point made him realize that a fixation of this kind to the subject\'s own body and his person was not something accidental, it is probable that this is the original condition of man (primary narcissism) out of which object love develops later without thereby necessarily affecting a disappearance of narcissism. This conception of narcissism was backed by evidence from a number of sources. In megalomania, we get the subjective over-estimation of self-importance, in dementia praecox we get the magical belief in the “omnipotence of thought.” Freud also studied the mind of the infant and the primitive man and here too discovered an expression of narcissism. There are also other situations in life like disease, after an accident, in old age etc., “when the tendency to this withdrawal into self-preoccupation is apt to become pronounced.” Normal love is also affected by a great deal of narcissism. The notion of narcissism was used to explain a wide range of distinct phenomena ranging from love, jealousy, and fear to mass phenomena. Continuing on these lines Fromm has worked out the spell of narcissism in group behavior, nationalism, and war. It was due to Fromm\'s insight that the concept of narcissism was salvaged from its limited base in the libido theory and given a more comprehensive interpretation. Fromm himself makes a reference to Buddhism which is extremely significant for an understanding of narcissism. Fromm says that the essential teachings of all the humanistic religions in the world can be summarized in one sentence: “It is the goal of man to overcome one\'s narcissism. Perhaps this principle is nowhere expressed more radically than in Buddhism.” Fromm concludes on these lines that if man sheds the “illusion of his indestructible ego” and the other objects of greed, only then can he be totally open, awake and be fully related to the world. The illusion of the indestructible ego that Fromm mentions is quite clearly a reference to the Buddhist doctrine of anattaa (egolessness). There is no ego entity existing apart and independently of those physical and mental processes that constitute life. The illusion of the ego has two basic forms: eternity belief and annihilation belief. The craving for selfish pursuits arises with a false conception of personality, based on the dogma of personal immortality (sassata-di.t.thi), and the craving for annihilation arises with a false conception of personality, based on the annihilationist view (uccheda di.t.thi). An understanding of the doctrine of sakkaaya-di.t.thi (twenty forms of wrong personality beliefs) helps us to grasp the Buddhist doctrine of egolessness. Where there is a mere complex of corporeality, feeling, perception, dispositions, and consciousness, the individual being subject to the ego illusion assumes the existence of an ego: 1-5: Ego is identified with corporeality, feeling, perception, dispositions, and consciousness. 6-10: Ego is contained in them. 11-15: Ego is independent of them. 16-20: Ego is their owner. This does not mean that the ego is merely an intellectual construction. The roots of the ego illusion are strong and it is fed by deep effective processes. These processes are dormant proclivities described in the Discourses of the Buddha as the latent desire for continued existence (bhava-raaga anusaya). The origin of the Freudian concept of narcissism is the point at which Narcissus falls in love with his own body. In relating auto-eroticism to narcissism, Freud says that the ego is first and foremost a “body-ego.” Fromm also says that one of the most elementary examples of narcissism can be found in the attitude to the body exhibited by the average person. Ego-illusion The narcissistic relation to one\'s body has its parallel in the doctrine of the Buddha, where he discusses the operation of personality beliefs (atta di.t.thi) in relation to corporeality. The majority of the people who are not skilled in the doctrine of the Buddha are subject to the ego-illusion associated with their body. This ego-illusion is described in the suttas: These people who are untrained in the doctrine of the Buddha, “regard body as the self (attaaa, Skr: aatman); they regard the self as having a body, body as being in the self, the self as being in the body. ‘I am the body,’ say they; ‘body is mine\'; and they are possessed by this idea.” The Buddha also says that due to the excessive attachment to the body, when it alters and changes, sorrow and grief set in; thus the doctrine of anattaa is linked to the doctrine of dukkha (suffering). However, while the body-image concept of the ego dominates the thought of Freud, the Buddha offers a more comprehensive analysis, relating the ego-illusion to feeling, perception, dispositions, and consciousness. To use a phrase of Wolheim, “the corporeal overtones of the ego concept” prevented Freud from presenting a broad base for his theory of narcissism. In fact, Wolheim has pointed out a significant ambiguity in the Freudian analysis of narcissism. Sometimes Freud conceives narcissism as an attraction towards one\'s own person, and sometimes as an attraction towards one\'s own body. Fromm has not merely re-vitalized the Freudian concept of narcissism, but takes it very much beyond this, and brings it close to the doctrine of the Buddha. Not merely does Fromm offer a theory of narcissism which is of interest to the Buddhist, but he quite clearly refers to the doctrine of the Buddha: “The ‘awakened’ person of whom Buddhist teaching speaks is the person who has overcome his narcissism, and who is therefore capable of being fully awake.” The Narcissistic “Self-Image” The narcissistic person is not only proud of his body but he has an exaggerated and inflated image of all aspects of his personality: his intelligence, his honor and his wealth, his social standing, etc. “Just as the narcissistic person has made his ‘self-image’ the object of his narcissistic attachment, he does the same with everything connected with him. His ideas, his knowledge, his house, but also people in his ‘sphere of interest’ become objects of his narcissistic attachment.” As both Freud and Fromm point out, one\'s narcissistic image about oneself is projected on to the children. This is extended to identification with wider groups, culminating in nationalism. Karen Horney was quick to point out that at the root of this kind of narcissistic self-image is found a kind of “self-inflation” rather than “self-love,” with a need not for love but the admiration of others. At this point we see the relevance of the Buddhist concept of maana (self-conceit). Self-conceit, according to the Buddha, takes three forms: I am superior to others (seyyo’ ham asmi-maana); I am equal to others (sadiso ‘ham asmi-maana); I am inferior to others (hino ‘ham asmi maana). Maana is one of the fetters that bind man to the ills of existence, and it varies from a crude feeling of pride to a subtle feeling of distinctiveness that prevails till the attainment of arahantship (sainthood). If a person is proud of his attainments, exaggerates them, and feels infuriated when someone gives a lower estimation of his doings, he suffers from an inflated sense of vanity (maana mada). If he feels frustrated, disappointed and underestimates his attainments he is subject to a kind of inferiority complex. This is similar to what Fromm describes as “depression.” “The element of mourning in melancholia refers, in my opinion to the narcissistic image of the wonderful ‘I’ which has died, and for which the depressed person is mourning.” Pride, vanity and conceit manifest clearly in interpersonal relations, as a reactive expression, as “wounded narcissism.” Its mechanism is similar to what Freud refers to as “secondary narcissism.” One\'s wounded narcissism gives way either to an ego collapse, depression and melancholy or to anger and fury. ',No

'In love with a statue?','They are more than rock and steel. They are memory and meaning. They are symbols and ideas that stand for something. From his earliest times man has been fascinated with creating monuments, some more than life size, others life size and some others miniature size. Daily News explores this pursuit of man that has chiseled its way into our consciousness from days before time itself was recorded. Daily News spoke to Dr. Pulsara Liyanage of the Faculty of Humanities, University of Kelaniya, to discover some prominent facts about statues. A big boulder “There are several types of statues. There are statues we refer to as monumental. Those are life size or larger than life size. The Greeks had larger than life size statues right from the beginning. They got their inspiration from Egypt, because inside the tombs we call pyramids there were larger than life size statues and outside even the Sphinx (with the woman’s face and bird’s wings and a lion’s tail) we call it monumental,” said Liyanage. “We have these larger than life size statues in Sri Lanka, especially in Buddhist iconography/ art. Avukana is a very good example. It is large and more than life size. It is in fact colossal and it is made out of stone. The Greeks used a particular technique called ‘hatching away.’ The Greeks and the Egyptians have created statues out of stones by hatching away the extra. They take a big boulder and they draw the statue on all four sides or three sides (Avukana has only three sides - the back is not carved because it is part of the boulder) the frontal and the two sides separately and then they hatch away the stone to reveal the figure. In the early Greek statues when they did that you can see that the three and sometimes four sides are not very coordinated. But Avukana is different, you can’t see the back at all. The Avukana statue is even symbolic of Sri Lanka that is why you have a reproduction of it in front of the BMICH.” One of the saddest days in history was when the Afghan fighters blasted similar statues that were even larger than the Avukana called the Bamiyan Buddha statues. These statues were works of great beauty and what happened was nothing short of shocking. “This is very interesting because the Bamiyans were positioned along the ancient silk route; this land route was a trade route which linked the west with China, and was used by traders of various nationalities. We do not know who created the Bamiyans but they were colossal statues out of sandstone in the Gandhara style. These were statues of the Buddha. They were dynamited and destroyed in March 2001 by the Taliban,” she added. Though positioned in different continents, the Bamiyan statues, Avukana and the Greek statues share similarities but how all of these similarities are connected to each other is yet to be determined. The Hellenistic Age “If you look at the pictures of the Archaic Greek statues, their facial features and those of certain Buddhist statues, have many similarities. In the early Archaic statues the fingers and toes were very long and of equal length. The Bamiyan had this feature and so does the Avukana. The strict frontal is there because it is to be viewed only from the front. And the physical features are also depicted full frontal,” said Liyanage. The Grecian culture spread to this part of Asia during the Hellenistic Age, which saw an intermingling of cultures and the formation of Greek cities in parts of Asia. “But we know that the Greeks were there in the North Western corner of Ancient India. Today part of it is Pakistan and another part is Afghanistan and for centuries there were Greek Kings in the area called Bactria. And in ‘Gandhara’ which was ruled by actual Greek Kings for a long time some of whom propagated Buddhism, and in fact the Buddhism that is written down comes as a result of a Greek King Menander asking the Ven. Nagasena about Buddhism because that religion was new to him. That is almost the canon of Buddhism. It is called ‘Milinda Panha’ - the Questions of Milinda. Milinda is the sanscritized version of the Greek name - Menander. And King Menander in Bactria had propagated Buddhism. In the earliest times Buddhism never depicted the picture of the Buddha. But later somewhere in the 1st and 2nd century CE in various parts of India the need arose for a statue to venerate or worship, so we have the different cultural traditions giving rise to the statue of the Buddha differently and separately in various parts of ancient India. But the Gandhara Buddha statue is different from all others, it looks very Greek,” she added. Statues, having a political and religious aspect to it figured prominently in the political and religious notions of that time. “These statues were originally made in different cultures for veneration as well as for decoration of the temples. You can see the Buddha statue used in the coins of even the Kushana Kings and also the Greek Kings. So these then become a symbol. It was a symbol of the Greek Kings, that they were very friendly towards Buddhism, because Buddhism would have been the religion of the people. Since the Greeks were outsiders, it was politically correct to adopt Buddhism,” said Liyanage. Afterlife and the paranormal “So you have the larger than life statues. The Greeks had it and the Buddhists have it. The Romans copied it from the Greeks and Christians adopted it from the Romans. And then you have the famous Statue of Liberty again as a symbol. It is colossal, it stands on a pedestal and symbolizes liberty and it is in the harbour. The concept seems to have been taken from the Greeks. In order to commemorate their victories, the Greeks created larger than life statues of the goddesses, such as Athena, standing on a pedestal to make it look even larger and imposing. It creates a certain idea in the minds of the person who sees it. The Greeks created statues for different reasons. Veneration was one of those. They combined veneration with the idea of supremacy. So they commemorated their victories over the Persians by creating huge statues inside their temples, standing on pedestals. Some of them would measure about 40 feet high. That is enormous. And a person walking into the temple is dwarfed by the image of the goddess who made the significant victory possible. Then they also made statues of their victors in the Olympics in order to make them immortal, since they brought great honour to the state,” she added. The afterlife and the paranormal seem to play a part in statue making. For the Egyptians, death was just another beginning. “Going by the Egyptians, human beings have created statues to ward off evil, to give fear, like the Sphinx standing near the pyramids. Egyptian art never evolved. That same formula is used throughout. You never see a statue for the living, the Egyptians created statues for the dead. They are there in lieu of people to serve the King. The Queen is there and the servants are there, and the horses are there, all depicted life size or larger. And the formula never changed,” she said. Animals have also found their way into the thoughts of men and women with sculptures of animals. “In most civilizations the theme of sculpture is largely human. In Greece and also in Sri Lanka and in India we have certain animal sculpture too-in India it is the elephant and later the monkey as Lord Hanuman, and in Greece it is the horse. There is a statue of a horse inside the newly refurbished Grand Stand at the former Race Course premises in Colombo. There is one also at the army camp in Slave Island, the unit whose emblem is a horse.” Life size statues are made in most modern cultures too. At the old parliament in Sri Lanka and in many of our junctions you may find the statues of politicians. All the dead politicians have statues. They include the statues of S W R D Bandaranaike, N M Perera, Ranjan Wijeratne, Lalith Athulathmudali, Ranasinghe Premadasa, Lakshman Kadirgamar etc. A kind of signal There were miniature statuettes in early human civilizations. “You had such statuettes in primitive cultures. In early Greece they used the potter’s wheel to shape some of these. And many were made by clay and terracotta. Few have survived. The Greeks as well as the Romans created replicas of human figures which they left in thanksgiving to the gods for saving a life or making a sick person healthy. You can’t serve the god eternally, so you make a replica of yourself as a memento of your eternal service to the gods,” said Liyanage. In molding out of clay, the sculptor looks at a photo of the person or the person himself, and molds the likeness. That kind of statue is different, and one of its purposes is to commemorate a departed individual. “This is different from the religious statues and commemorative statues. In Sri Lanka today, in villages and in cemeteries, you will see a replica of a soldier with a gun. Sometimes it is mounted on a bus halt, made in memory of the person who had died in action. The statue gives you the message. When the family of a fallen soldier sees the statue, they feel proud that is their father, brother or husband. Take Rukmani Devi, she was beautiful and famous, and her statue was where she met with her fatal accident. Not an artistically perfect statue, but when you see it, it is white, and is a kind of signal to drivers, because that area of the road is prone to skidding. So when you see this white statue, drivers will be cautious,” she added. In Buddhist statues or any religious statue, you find they are all alike because there is always a canon. Only the eyes or the shape of the face according to the artist would differ. So even in Sri Lanka when you look at the ancient statues, if you look at them very carefully you will see that the expressions are different on the face. “There is a canon and there is very little that can be changed. To most people the far away, completely otherworldly expression, is serene and they identify with that. In the Buddha statues you have the seated and the reclining. Reclining is always Parinibbana (Great demise) - one hand under the head and the other stretched out. It is called Lion like pose. In Sigiriya there are ancient Aranyas. In one such historic Aranya there is a reclining Buddha statue made out of brick. Usually the Buddha statue is not made out of brick. The Department of Archaeology had left part of the brick exposed, for people to see, that this is one of a kind. The material used and the artistry used- those are all different,” said Liyanage. The more important Greek statues for veneration were covered with fine gold leaves. During the war when they needed money they melted the gold. God or no god, reality is more important and they melted it and made coins. ',No

'Sri Lankan Sensei, and art of peace','“We are samurais: we have to face any situation. There’s nothing I can say more than that.” Sugumar John Ratnam, just shy of 60, can overpower men half his age with ease and grace. He may not be Japanese, but he is the closest thing to a samurai you are likely to find in Dubai. As the chief instructor and founder of the UAE’s first Aikido school. Mr. Ratnam, known to his students as John Sensei, is an ardent pacifist – despite living in a region rife with conflict. In the heart of Dubai, he and his students are on a mission to bring peace and harmony to the world – starting with themselves. “This current situation, where people are killing everywhere, is not right. That is the what people did before we had civilisation and education. In those days, they killed each other,” he pauses, “like animals.” Martial arts instructor Despite the technological advances in his lifetime, the Sri Lankan sensei believes people have not changed in thousands of years. “The world is going backwards these days because there is no care; there is no authentic way of life.” To some, it might seem odd for a martial arts instructor to denounce fighting so strongly. However, Aikido is a martial art unlike any other. Mixed-martial-arts (MMA) fighters scoff at its lack of competition, as they aim to dominate – by submission or knockout. They seek the most practical way to deal with threats in a reality riddled with competition and conflict. Aikido sets itself in a utopian context. Though it can be used for self-defence, it is not practised for self-defence. This is the philosophy that akidoka – Aikido practitioners – aims to manifest into real life. “We are practising for good health, for good mind, for good spirit, good friendship and a good life. We don’t want to hurt and we don’t want to get beaten up by someone else,” stresses Mr. Ratnam. Aikido is not, strictly-speaking, a martial art but a form of budo – the Japanese term for a martial arts dedicated to self-development, as opposed to bujutsu – martial arts dedicated to defeating an enemy. Its techniques focus on joint locks and manipulations, as well as physics, to unbalance the attacker, redirect their energy, throw and pin them. “When you come across MMA, everybody is young. I’m almost 60-years-old and I’m still training and I think I’ve got years left. But I don’t think anyone can do MMA at 60 years – they have to break their bones.” The founder of Aikido, Morihei Ueshiba, lived until 85 – leading training sessions up to the month before his death in 1969. A much-revered figure, he is referred to as O Sensei (great teacher) or Kaiso (the founder). Although different branches of Aikido vary, the budo, steeped in discipline and ritual, has changed very little since his death. Entering and leaving, students bow to the dojo itself. Before training begins, they sit in silence – adopting the Japanese seiza sitting position, with their heels beneath their rumps – in hierarchical order. There is then a series of bows exchanged between the students and their sensei, as well as towards the shomen – the front wall, where a photograph of Ueshiba hangs. Before becoming a martial arts instructor, Mr. Ratnam worked as a film choreographer, billboard painter, stuntman and magician. He also founded an accountancy firm. Along the way he has mastered, or dabbled in, wrestling, karate, kung fu, judo, Aikido, and the weapons martial arts kendo, yaido and jodo. After more than 30 years of Aikido he is today a 4th Dan grade. In theory, the highest level is 10th Dan, although few have achieved this. His mission has seen him set up dojos in Sri Lanka, Kuwait, Mauritius and South Africa. He established the UAE’s first Aikido dojo, the Dubai Aikido Club – now known as Zanshinkan – in 1995. The dojo is a member of the Aikido Association International, set up by the legendary Aikido expert – or Shihan – Fumio Toyoda. Mr. Ratnam earned his own Shihan in England in 1994, after which he trained with Moriteru Ueshiba, the grandson of the budo’s founder, in the Aikikai Aikido World Headquarters, the original Aikido school, in Hombu, Japan. There are seven initial grades in Aikido, called kyu grades. Following this, students reach the black belt Dan grades. However, this is “just the beginning”, says Mr. Ratnam, to an “international membership to the Hombu dojo”. Spiritual aspect “If you want a teaching licence from Hombu dojo, you must have a 4th Dan – and for that you must have at least 15 to 16 years of experience.” The Dan grades also involve essay-writing on topics such as the history, principles and techniques of Aikido. “At some of the schools here, you can buy belts in a very short time but we have certain years that they have to complete, because I’m responsible for my association. I’m very loyal to my senseis – we don’t have any hanky-panky here.” Zanshinkan has trained almost 32 black belters since it began. The dojo’s highest graded student is an Australian, 3rd Dan Cathy Darnell, who Mr. Ratnam honorifically refers to as Cathy-san. Ms Darnell has trained under Mr. Ratnam for almost 15 years and says he is the best teacher in the Middle East for beginners. “In Dubai there’s so much materialism, but for people who have this yearning that something’s missing within them, I think John is the best one. Especially for blokes. He has a spiritual aspect and he’s also got the martial; so, you can see that he could put you down quick but he’s also got the softness, the yin and the yang.” Though she began Aikido to help her better connect with people, she found it taught her how to connect with herself. For her, Aikido is not just the martial art of the 21st century, but the “number one martial art for the Middle East”. Another female student, the 2nd Kyu Susan Joehri, started Aikido after finding Kung Fu a bit too “macho man”. The Swiss akidoka says: “It was really different and it attracted me immediately. I think it’s everything: it’s the philosophy, it’s the physical aspect and (working with) all of your emotions and your energy.” Committing to the budo, she says, has been an exercise in discipline, but discipline is key to success, according to Mr. Ratnam. Aikido, he admits, is very confusing for beginners. But that is a good thing, he adds, because it allows you to enter the state of mushin, no-mindedness. “Empty your cup, so you can fill it with knowledge.” Mr. Ratnam says while Aikido has been the most important, all of the martial art forms he has practised have built his character. “In wrestling, there was always a competition: we always think we need to beat somebody to get a medal. It encourages destroying somebody, which is very bad. You start telling yourself you’re some kind of hero, you take the medal and the next day you get beaten up; there’s another man smiling and you’re in pain. It also happened in karate. I had many injuries, and I injured many people too.” He is also an expert in yaido, a form of weapons training that complements Aikido. Just as the finest samurai’s sword takes much time, patience and effort to forge, so too does the finest warrior, he says. He continues: “When sensei says ‘you are the sword’, then I know if I am a sword, I can do anything: I can kill at any time. So, the real, well-trained samurai’s sword never comes out. He will control the threat. Because when you draw the sword, somebody has to die.” Road rage Many people, he says, give into the allure of violence – road rage being an example. “Everybody has an ego, sometimes, the egos rises up. If somebody yelling at you, or showing you the finger in your car, it is not worth it.” Amid such disharmony, akidoka are trying to live by Ueshiba’s teachings, insists Mr. Ratnam. “The way of sitting, the way of listening – this is an art. It is very difficult to get that part right.” Even the name of the dojo, Zanshinkan, symbolises the respect and care that Aikidoku should pay to their budo and its traditions. The different pleats of the hakuma skirt represent the virtues of the samurai – kindness, etiquette and morality, manners, knowledge and awareness, faith and belief. “Then there are two other pleats, sincerity and loyalty. But these biggest pleats are hidden – because today I don’t think a lot of places have loyalty or sincerity.” Loyalty is Mr. Ratnam’s biggest priority – it is samurai etiquette after all. “Going for battle as a warrior, you don’t know if you’re coming back or if you’ll die. But you’re not going to live forever … every day is a new day and we are born again, that way we can do the best all day, with a lot of energy and enthusiasm. But for that, we need discipline and we need etiquette.” As the room falls completely silent, save the concentrated breathing of his students, he concludes: “Nobody in Aikido will ever say they learnt for five years. I attended a seminar in Japan with Kanazawa-sensei, the karate sensei. At that time, Kanazawa-sensei was already about 72-years-old. “He said ‘I’ve been practising karate for 60 years, but I’m not good enough’. And with everybody in shock, he said ‘one day my karate will be good – if I see that I am a good human being, then I can proudly say my karate is good’.” halbustani@thenational.ae Courtesy: TheNationalUAE ',No
'Eat your statues','The gleaming ice-chiselled swan, bold yet yummy looking chocolaty warrior poised for battle with a bow and arrow, flashy flower petals carved out from vegetables, and ash pumpkins turned into attractive pots and baskets hog your attention. If only wishes were horses and one possessed a magic wand, these tantalizing statues could be zapped into life! However outlandish it may sound, if you meet Hilton Colombo Residences’ Kitchen Artist Nissanka Samarakoon it may well be a reality! With over two decades of experience in the sector Chef Samarakoon has worked in countries like Beirut and Dubai. He has enthralled many with his vegetable, butter, chocolate, ice, dough and foam creations.  World’s largest edible sculpture \r\n \t\t\tin the form of the Taj Mahal    Multi Colours    The Stallion   Hilton Colombo Residences’ \r\n \t\t\tKitchen Artist\r\n \t\t\tNissanka Samarakoon  “Carved vegetable and fruits enhance the buffet table. Vegetable carvings are placed mostly near the cold kitchen items such as salads. Fruit showpieces are normally found near the pastry section. An ice carving can be placed in any part of the venue. It is difficult to do ice carvings in areas like Kandy because they do not possess factories which make the required blocks of ice. There are risks involved while doing ice carvings. If the design does not come out right or if a portion is sliced off by accident, you cannot do anything to correct that mistake. It is easy to do alterations while doing chocolate and butter carvings. A vegetable carving is done only for one event because the materials used for the décor begin to wither,” he said. Gastronomic adventures Food carving competitions are quite popular in the culinary scene. Chefs engage in gastronomic adventures as they turn food into works of art. Guided by their hands, disparate ingredients conspire to combine into dishes that titillate the taste buds and entertain the eyes. Chef Samarakoon notes that there are certain rules and regulations when a sculpture is presented for a competition. “We are not allowed to use wire for the sculptures. However it is a different story if you are creating a sculpture for a hotel function. You can use almost anything to beautify the work of art. Each vegetable or fruit is used for a purpose. For example we normally use radish and carrots to carve flowers. Similarly fruits and vegetables with the kernel like papaw and pumpkin are used as the base,” he said. A knife and some interest is the main thing you need to learn carving. Patience, an artistic temperament and concentration matter a great deal. A carving knife held in different angles can work wonders in turning out different shapes. Selecting the right vegetables and fruits is also important. “You can create many varieties of flowers from a fruit or vegetable. For example you can carve many varieties of roses from beetroot, carrot, radish, turnip and tomato. If a fruit is too ripe the design does not come out well. You need to choose the ingredients appropriately to make your design come out well. There are no rules for creativity. Any vegetable or fruit can be turned into a stunning piece with imagination,” he said. It is certainly a feast for your eyes! Converting edible food into articles of brilliant spectacle may be a piece of cake but, the icing comes from years of hard work, perseverance, patience and an inner desire to create. Unique trait “Sometimes our clients relate what kind of design goes with their theme and I create the design according to that theme. For example a couple once told me that they are going for a sea related wedding theme. I suggested an anchor and fish design for the event. However each and every design done by an artist differs though the theme might be the same. Each individual has his or her own unique trait. Some add a lot of colours to their designs while some prefer to use the natural shades of the product. It all depends on the eyes of the beholder,” he explained. Apart from weddings they also get requests for sculptures to go with birthday functions, High Tea and theme nights. “We go wild with our imaginations for theme nights. We create designs taking the countries, cultures and other aspects to mind. My favourite among the sculptures I have created so far is themed ‘Adam and Eve.’ I did that it in Beirut for a competition for which I won the gold medal. It was a chocolate sculpture with the Bible as the base. Eve’s hair springs out of the Bible and the couple are standing together grasping an apple,” he said. Speaking about the kind of sculptures which are most in demand Chef Samarakoon said that many couples demand the first letter of their names to be carved on the sculptures. An ice carving normally lasts for around three hours inside a hall. Chocolate carvings are the most expensive out of the lot. Stainless steel sculptures Apart from sculptures using traditional ingredients Chef Samarakoon also does creative decor using stainless steel. He is the only kitchen artist in Sri Lanka to make stainless steel sculptures. “The concept originated after I was shown some images done by a chef in Kuala Lumpur by our GM Manesh Fernando. I studied those images, selected the items from the shops and tried my hands at designing some of the pieces. The designs came out well and later I was able to do some creations of my own unique designs. Many people including celebrities like Bathiya and Santhush, Mahela Jayawardene and Kumar Sangakkara have commented about these designs,” he noted with pride.   An ice carving    World’s largest chocolate sculpture \r\n \t\t\tunder construction    The Beauty  He says that this form of art is time consuming as well as difficult to master compared with the traditional food carvings found across the country. The steel needs to be welded to create a piece. Vegetable and fruit carving originated in Thailand 700 years ago. Merging their natural affinity for beauty and love for food, the Thai people created extraordinary carvings out of ordinary fruits and vegetables. This ancient tradition has been passed down by generations for thousands of years and today it is considered a true mark of culinary excellence. Throughout the years people have experimented and have come up with some truly striking products in the creative carvings sector. The record holders for the tallest ice sculpture in the world are the people of Yichun City, China. Around 120 people built a dinosaur sculpture, at a little over 53 feet tall, in 20 days. Chocolate-lovers need look no further for a place to pay homage to their favourite treat after Chocolatiers created a mouth-watering edible sculpture of an ancient Mayan temple in 2012. The miniature version of the Kukulcan pyramid based in Chichen Itza in Mexico weighing an incredible 18,239lb, the equivalent of two adult elephants, broke records as the world’s largest chocolate sculpture. The world’s largest edible sculpture, however, is not made out of any of these products. It is a replica of India’s landmark, the Taj Mahal, and is recreated out of 1.2 million grains of rice, 18 bags of mini poppadoms, 10 jars of mango chutney, 30 green chilies and 40 chapattis! This 3ft by 10ft by 5ft version took food artist Prudence Staite five days, seven hours and 30 minutes to construct in 2011. “You have to possess an innate skill to excel in the field. A cook has a menu and the amount of ingredients written out for a recipe. However a kitchen artist should not have such boundaries. Experience will polish your skills,” Chef Samarakoon advised. ',No
'Hundreds of giant African snails seized in US','US captures 1,200 of molluscs, considered a delicacy by some, as they can affect eco-systems and spread diseases to humans The giant African snail damages buildings, destroys crops and can cause meningitis in humans. But some people still want to collect – and even eat – the slimy invaders. The US agriculture department (USDA) is trying to stop them and since June has seized more than 1,200 live specimens of the large snails, also known as giant African land snails. All were traced back to one person in Georgia, who was selling them illegally. The USDA discovered the snails through a tip from social media at the end of June. It seized more than 200 snails in Long Island, New York, from a person who identified the seller in Georgia. The department interviewed the trader and seized almost 1,000 more snails, plus one each in Indiana, Pennsylvania and New York. Agriculture officials said the investigation was ongoing and they would not identify any of the individuals. The snails multiply quickly, producing 1,200 or more offspring a year, and fully grown can be the size of a fist. They have no natural predators in the US, with humans their only threat. Florida authorities know this all too well. Agriculture officials there are in their third year of trying to eradicate the snails. They were discovered in Miami in September 2011, and have been found on houses, where they eat plaster and stucco to gain calcium for their shells, and in residential gardens, where they tear through plants. Mark Fagan, a spokesman for the Florida department of agriculture, said the agency has found 141,000 snails in 26 areas of Miami-Dade County. Luckily, he said, they have not spread to the state’s rich agricultural areas. The snails eat 500 types of plants, including most row crops and citrus, so keeping them away is an important investment for the state’s $100bn-a-year (£60bn) farm industry. Florida first saw the giant snails in the 1960s, when a boy from Miami was believed to have smuggled some of them in from Hawaii. His grandmother eventually released his snails into her garden – starting an infestation that took 10 years to eradicate. Fagan said state officials do not know how the latest infestation started. But people have different reasons for importing the snails. Sometimes they arrive accidentally in luggage or cargo. The USDA believes most of the snails seized this year were being collected by people who wanted them as pets. They are also used in some African religious practices and in some cosmetic procedures. Some people consider the snails a delicacy. One person who apparently saw them as food tried to bring 67 live snails into California in July. US customs and border protection at Los Angeles airport intercepted the snails, which were declared by a person from Nigeria as aimed for human consumption in Corona, California. Customs officers said the person appeared not to know that importation of live snails was illegal. Eating or handling them could be dangerous, government officials said. According to the centres for disease control and prevention, the snails can carry a parasitic worm that can lead to meningitis. The agriculture department said it wants to warn people about the threat as they may not know the snails are prohibited in the US, and if those people report that they have them, they won’t face any penalties. Those who knowingly import them could face fines. “The more people who know about giant African snails and know that they are illegal in the US, the better we are in keeping them out,” said Wendolyn Beltz, a director in the USDA’s animal and plant health inspection service. “If they didn’t know and they are reaching out to us to do the right thing, there will be absolutely no penalties for that.” It is legal to import frozen giant African snails for consumption in the US, and live snails are legal and available in some parts of Europe, as well as other foreign countries, so people may not be aware of the US ban. The snails seized by the USDA this summer came from Britain, the department said. Dr Jim Young, an entomologist at USDA who identifies snails and other species intercepted in international commerce, said the best bet is just to be careful when you are abroad. “Don’t play with snails when you are on vacation,” he said.

'Sports Medical Unit added to Colombo National hospital','For the first time in the history of Sri Lanka, a Sports Medical Unit has been added to the Colombo National Hospital. In similar fashion, 12 medical units too have been added to the country-wide hospitals. This Unit which has the unstinting support of Hospital Director Dr. Anil Jasinghe, would be named as the National Centre of Sports Medical Science. The creation of this special unit to treat sportsmen and women is of historical importance at a time the National Hospital completes 150 years of yeoman service to the nation. According to Orthopedic Specialist and Surgeon of the National Hospital Dr. G. L. Punchihewa, the special unit would treat sportsmen and women and would also take steps to educate and enhance their knowledge on nutrition, give them tips on how to avoid accidents and also provide them the opportunity to undergo pre-medical tests. The Unit would also conduct clinics and seminars targetting the sportsmen and women and officials involved in this Unit would cover sports meets held in National and International level and would also provide necessary advise to those seeking advise in selecting the most suitable sports. The Unit would have the services of six doctors with special training and a group of nurses and a workforce to run the daily routine.',No
'First-aid and emergency medical treatment can prevent 30 pc deaths','About 30 percent of deaths can be prevented through proper first-aid and emergency medical treatment handling, said Falck Sri Lanka Chief Commercial Officer Shane de Silva. He was addressing an awareness program on First Aid and Emergency Medical Services for media personnel at the Falck office in Ratmalana. “Falck is a world wide organisation and Falck Sri Lanka\'s intention is to ensure that we expand our services to this country and also to ensure that people will help people as any person can help save a life,” he said. Falck Sri Lanka Chief Executive Officer Jens Paul Madsen said that emergency medical service is an essential part of the overall healthcare system as it saves lives by providing immediate care. “Although globally accepted, the concept of emergency medical service is still in its early development stage. However, we are certain that with proper awareness, people will identify the importance of emergency medical service,” he said. Falck\'s goal is to build a system which all communities will be served by a well planned and highly coordinated emergency care system that will ensure a reduction in preventable death and disability. Falck provides Emergency First Aid training to school teachers to empower them as the “first on sight” during an emergency in school and also train traffic patrol teams in schools as they will be the first responders if any accident occur in the surrounding areas outside the school premises. Measures have also been taken by Falck Sri Lanka to train the staff of Disaster Management Centre on emergency handling. They also plan to educate traffic police pertaining to Flack\'s services on emergency first aid. The training will include critical life saving skills, which the police can administer during an emergency until professional help arrives.  ',Yes
'In Singapore’s Shadows','It was a single death that sparked the riot. Then the riot sparked a spouting of racist hatred that belies Singapore’s very orderly image – just as the country’s leaders were urging their multicultural populace to live in peace and harmony. From the late 1960s until last Sunday night, the closest Singapore has ever come to a race riot was in June this year when McDonald’s offered locals a Hello Kitty soft toy in blackface, with an order of burger and fries. Bad idea. The inner Singaporean was uncorked. Chaos reigned under the Golden Arches across this uptight island usually so obsessed with its international image. Spoilt kids screamed at parents, who sharpened elbows and boots, and jumped queues for tickets that got faster access to the Kitty litter. This being Singapore, a roaring secondary scalpers’ market emerged online for both tickets and Kittys. It’s perhaps instructive to note that the World Bank ranks Singaporeans as the globe’s third-wealthiest people, after Qatar and Luxembourg. Images of The Ugly Singaporean, and there were many, were inevitably captured on phones, and quickly despatched to YouTube posterity: One grumpy dad railed at no-one in particular when a compatriot reached Hello Kitty utopia before he did. “Is this a human being?” he raged. “Is he a Singaporean? Is he educated? Does he deserve a ticket?” McDonald’s should’ve known better, because it was involved in the previous pseudo-riot experienced by Singapore in 2000, also involving Hello Kitty. The Japanese-owned feline phenomenon was this time allured with wedding clobber. Stores were swamped and their plate-glass windows smashed, as were faces, by parental fists flailing in millennial mayhem. Mandela’s legacy Perhaps McDonald’s and Sanrio, Hello Kitty’s corporate owner, should consider rolling out a Mandela version of the cat, to get the global love flowing. Not that there’s much chance of that happening in Singapore. Local strongman Lee Kuan Yew was among the many mourners lavishing treacle on Mandela’s legacy after Madiba’s recent death, doubtless not reflecting on the fact that Lee was responsible for the plight of Chia Thye Poh, a dissident who has been dubbed Asia’s Mandela. Chia was a political rival of Lee’s in the 1960s. Fingered by Lee as a communist, Chia was stripped of his citizenship and detained, without trial, by Lee’s government for 32 years – five years longer than Mandela endured.  An injured person There was little of Mandela’s famed forgiveness in evidence on Singapore’s Racecourse Road during last Sunday night’s very real riot, when workers from the subcontinent went on a rampage after one of their number was struck by a bus and died. Earlier that day, the Lee family fief, the People’s Action Party (PAP), had been holding its annual convention, marking 54 years of uninterrupted power. The PAP passed an eight-point mission statement for Singaporeans. One of its points: the PAP would foster a Singaporean identity that allows different races, religions and backgrounds to “live harmoniously together, embrace one another as fellow citizens and work together for a better Singapore”. The PAP passed its plan on Sunday, which happens to be the one day of the week that the million-odd low-wage foreign workers in Singapore – people such as 33-year-old Indian labourer Sakthivel Kumaravelu, who make up about 20 per cent of the island nation’s population – have as time off. A few hours after the state-controlled Straits Times made public the PAP edicts, Singapore’s Little India was aflame; Sakthivel Kumaravelu had been killed while enjoying his holiday with friends, struck by a bus driven by a Singaporean. The national Kumbaya moment hadn’t lasted long. Singapore’s police force describes what happened next. “A riot broke out involving a crowd of about 400 subjects where the subjects damaged several vehicles including 16 police vehicles. About 300 Police Officers, including those from the Special Operations Command and the Gurkha Contingent, responded to the scene. The accident victim, a 33-year-old Indian national, succumbed to his injuries and was pronounced dead at scene…. 22 Police Officers and 5 Auxilliary [sic] Police Officers have sought treatment at the hospital. The officers sustained injuries and lacerations. The driver of the private bus, a 55-year-old Singaporean, was conveyed conscious to the hospital. 27 subjects, aged 23 to 45, have been arrested in connection with the rioting incident. Out of the 27 subjects, 24 are Indian nationals, two are Bangladeshi nationals and one is a Singaporean Permanent Resident.” Foreign workers Kumaravelu’s tragic demise wasn’t exactly mourned by Singaporeans. Indeed, his passing seemed almost a footnote to the story. It took a fair amount of digging into local news reports to determine what, in fact, had prompted the riot, the thrust of the attention being more on the rioters. On Singapore’s Channel News Asia, which likes to think of itself as Asia’s CNN, the anchor mentioned his death only in passing. The riot set off the island’s barely concealed racial torchpaper, most conspicuously in the online comments section of the quasi-official Straits Times. “Cane these hooligans and let them rot in jail”, posted one reader. Posted another; “a lot of Indian and Bangla foreign workers arrested. Good … hang them all. The rest who watched and did nothing, send to Saudi Arabia as slaves … Problem solved!” Noted yet another: “foreign trash are working over time … pappy (Singapore slang for the ruling PAP) ask us to be what, inclusive and more tolerant? Think these two words should stuff up into the spokesperson’s body where the sun don’t shine. That what you get when ICA (Singapore immigration) approve the work permits like toilet papers, in rolls. They allow the companies to employed CHEAP foreigners, so this is what you get.” When other posters pleaded for calm and rational discussion, they were swiftly condemned by the baying online mob. “Oh, I should be more caring, so one wrong word and they riot? So why don’t you spend your time going down there now to comfort these trash or start a campaign IN PERSON to champion for these trash?” For Singaporeans, race is a discussion that’s ordinarily out of bounds, a forbidden topic lying beyond what are commonly known as ‘OB markers’. The term derives from golf, a passion of the Singaporean elite – the so-called “cosmopolitan” regime insiders who lord it over less-advantaged heartlanders. The vast bulk of the Singaporean population, heartlanders have been agitated in recent years by the arrival in significant numbers of armies of foreign workers, people like the late Sakthivel Kumaravelu, to cheaply do the jobs most Singaporeans won’t. Social media OB markers aren’t so much formally codified by the state – though the former editor of the Straits Times once had a go, after his retirement. Rather, they have become understood by self-censoring Singaporeans, the boundaries usually determined after someone strays across a line and gets whacked back into suffocation by the PAP government – typically by public admonishment, the threat of punishment and, on occasion, lawsuits and detention. For many Singaporeans, baiting foreigners is fair game, until someone important says it’s not. The anonymous trash-talking in social media about unfortunates, such as Sakthivel Kumaravelu allows Singaporeans to air irrational, even pent-up, racial grievances and still appear to stay inside OB markers. OB markers mostly seem to surface around election time. What would pass for reasonable political debate in most countries tends in Singapore to be curtailed by OB markers; criticising the ruling party and the wealthy Lee regime is a good way to cop a crippling libel suit. Corruption and state wastage is another OB marker, as is discussion of the huge salaries politicians pay themselves, and the business activities of the ruling Lee family too. In recent years, examination of the nationally public business activities of the state sovereign fund Temasek Holdings, (run by Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong’s wife Ho Ching), has become out of bounds. OB markers also extend to foreign media. In reporting the story of Sunday’s riot, Forbes Magazine, which publishes Lee Kuan Yew as a contributor, was quick to point out that the weekend’s disturbances didn’t represent a race riot. Forbes is published in Singapore. Race and its close relation, religion, are societal dynamite in Singapore, and in neighbouring Malaysia, which the island was once part of. The race riots of 1964 and 1969, in which mostly Buddhist Chinese and Muslim Malays attacked and killed each other – the ugliness held out by authorities as a dystopia no-one wants – strongly define the social character of modern Singapore. Cultural erosion and crime No matter that the average Singaporean wouldn’t even faintly countenance doing such work, the presence in numbers of unskilled foreign labour in Singapore sets off urban grumbles about jobs, cultural erosion and crime. The xenophobia hasn’t quite descended to the extremes of foreigners being blamed for freeway gridlock, as happened in Australia during the recent election campaign, but if Singapore’s flaming internet forums are any guide, that’s not far off. The Singaporean charity, Transient Workers Count Too, says there are about a million low-wage migrant workers in Singapore, a good few of them off the books. Official Singapore-government statistics show that there are almost 1.3 million foreign workers servicing the Singapore boom, compared to 3.3 million Singapore citizens. Transient Workers Count Too is a small but passionate voice trying to cut through a controlling Singaporean regime traditionally suspicious of NGO’S. “Migrant workers contribute immensely to Singapore society and our economy,” they say, “yet they often suffer unconscionable exploitation.” It describes migrants’ working conditions, which Singaporeans wouldn’t tolerate. They include long shifts with few breaks, dismal accommodation and missed paydays. But what’s not evident in official statistics or ministerial rhetoric is the grief many foreign workers have suffered working in Singapore, a supposed employment El Dorado where instead they can find themselves vilified and dehumanised by hosts who are deaf to their reasonable concerns. There are the upfront loan repayments to sponsors and employment-agency sharks back home, the intimidation and harassment of their families for money, the pent-up frustrations of the culturally displaced poor, some of whom hail from democracies where striking and public protest are lawful and commonplace, and who don’t quite get the notion of OB markers. It all amounts to indentured labour, and sure, such matters can fall outside Singapore’s official control – that is, if the country much cared beyond its perennial need to meet a construction deadline.

'N. Korea warns of nuclear disaster','SOUTH KOREA: North Korean leader Kim Jong-Un said Wednesday the Korean peninsula would be engulfed by \"massive nuclear disaster\" if war breaks out there again, warning the US it will not be safe in the event of a conflict. \"If the war breaks out again in this land, it will bring about a massive nuclear disaster and the US will never be safe,\" Kim said in his New Year message, broadcast on state TV. \"We are faced with a dangerous situation in which a small, accidental military clash can lead to an all-out war,\" he said. Kim added he would not beg for peace and vowed to protect the impoverished but nuclear-armed North with strong self-defence measures against enemies. The young leader also hailed the recent execution of his powerful uncle as a \"resolute action,\" labelling Jang Song-Thaek \"scum\". \"Our party took resolute action to remove... scum elements within the party last year,\" Kim said, accusing Jang of trying to build his own powerbase within the ruling party. \"Our party\'s timely, accurate decision to purge the anti-party, anti-revolutionary elements helped greatly cement solidarity within our party,\" he said. It was the first time Kim has publicly criticised his disgraced uncle, who was executed on December 12 on charges including treason and corruption. Jang, 67, played a key role in cementing the leadership of the inexperienced Kim Jong-Un, who took power after the death of his father and longtime ruler, Kim Jong-Il, in December 2011. But Jang\'s growing political power and influence drew resentment from his nephew barely half of his age, analysts said. AFP ',No
Appreciations,'Justin Subasingha: Extremely congenial personality Justin Subasingha, who was a pioneer member and the inaugural secretary of the Millagahawattha Welfare Society, passed away on February 3, 2006 after a brief illness. He had been the former Supplies Manager at the National Paper Corporation and was a kind hearted, soft spoken social worker as well. The Millagahawattha Welfare Society was inaugurated in the year 1985, in the Millagahawattha area at Thalangama North in Malabe, for the purpose of fulfilling the requirements and shortcomings of the residents of the area. As Secretary, Justin Subasingha played the key role of the society and made great endeavours to solve all community problems that arose from time to time. For instance, at that time the road leading to Millagahawattha was a cart track. The road had been tarred only for a short distance from the main road and even the street lights were not functioning properly. Justin wrote many letters in this connection to the relevant authorities but there had been no response whatsoever. However he did not give up but persuaded the matter until finally, necessary steps were taken to rectify the shortcoming. Today we have a well maintained tarred road with street lights, as a result of Justin\'s dedicated service. When our welfare society decided to publish a souvenir in connection with its second anniversary, Justin Subasingha proposed that we enrich our funds by publishing advertisements in the proposed souvenir. However we were unable to obtain the advertisements as required. At that stage, he undertook the challenge alone, and with the connections he had established at the Paper Corporation, collected a considerable number of advertisements for the souvenir, which resulted finally in our society gaining financially. I developed close association with Justin around the year 1986. I had a keen interest in social work and held the position of Treasurer of the welfare society. Subasingha was my mentor as well as good friend. I learned a lot of social work and ethics from him. He held several offices as Secretary and then President. Later on when he was appointed as Patron of the welfare society, although he did not hold any office, he gave his fullest support and encouragement to the other Office Bearers in all aspects. He suggested long term proposals and implemented them. These valuable proposals have been implemented and are yielding good results to members. He also held the key role in the committee appointed to prepare the constitution of our welfare society. Justin Subasingha was a devoted Buddhist and had close associations with the Chief Incumbent of the temple. He was a loving husband to his wife, caring father to his children and also to his grandchildren. Above all, he possessed good qualities such as kindness, tolerance and generosity. His loving, kind, innocent and genuine smile will never be forgotten. He was a highly principled and extremely congenial personality. He was a wonderful person who lived a very accomplished life. No one is immortal. We all have to take leave from this world one day, which is a harsh reality. Justin Subasingha\'s demise is an irreparable loss to us. May he attain the supreme bliss of Nibbana! SISIRA GUNASEKERA MALABE Eresha Nilmini: Sacrificed her life for sake of country Memories are all that remain of Corporal Eresha Nilmini of the Sri Lanka Womens\' Corps and the Sri Lanka Military Police. She was the first military woman to have died a victim of LTTE terrorism. She left her two sisters and parents forever, seventeen years ago. Born on May 2, 1974 Eresha received her education at St. Joseph’s Convent, Nugegoda where she was a good student both in studies as well as in sports. She also had the privilege of being a teacher at the Christ Church Sunday School at Kotte. Eresha was a beauty by birth and participated in many beauty contests. She was among the finalists of the Miss Jessy Queen of the Dehiwala/Mt Lavinia and Kotte areas and also in the Miss Sri Lanka for the World Contest in 1992. On completion of her studies she sought employment and her first appointment was at Asiri Hospital, Narahenpita as a Receptionist. Since she developed a liking to join the elite Military Police, she applied for a position and was one among the eight who were selected out of 8,000 applicants. As military duties called, she found herself posted to the Northern area during the period of the LTTE war, after completing her initial period in Colombo and was in the rank of a Corporal at the time. When she was serving in Palalai, the Assistant Parish Priest Rev. Fr. Emil Joseph of Kotte had a dreadful dream one night, that Eresha had stepped on a claymore mine and that her body was blasted to pieces. He related the dream to her parents on December 27, 1996. On the morning of January 2, 1997 a friend of her parents, Edward and Christobel, informed them that Eresha had met with an accident while serving at the Palalai camp. The father rushed to Army Head Quarters only to learn that his daughter Eresha had been blasted in a landmine. The parents realized that the dream of Rev. Fr. Emil Joseph a week back was correct. Her remains were brought down and she was accorded a military funeral. Thus ended the life of Eresha Nilmini, a lovable daughter with soft spoken endearing qualities. Never a harsh word had escaped her lips although she was in a tough job. Let me end by quoting the words of Rev. Fr. Emil Joseph, who officiated at the funeral high mass “God took back what He gave you.” W.M.S.K. ABEYRATNA\r\n WEWALA, DAMBULLA Velupillai Kandasamy: He sacrificed life for workers’ rights The 64th anniversary of the demise of V. Kandasamy, a clerk in the then Department of Medical and Sanitary services fell on June 5, last year. He sacrificed his youthful life for trade union rights. Velupillai Kandasamy hailed from Vadukoddai, Jaffna and joined the government clerical service. Brimming with youthful exuberance Kandasamy, in his early twenties was highly engrossed with activities of the GCSU a vibrant active trade union at the dawn of our independence. He lost his life when the police opened fire at Dematagoda to dispense a procession of strikers headed by N.M. Perera. The LSSP staged a strike of Colombo harbour workers on November 22, 1945 making several demands in consequence of which, N.M. Perera, Philip Gunawardene Leslie Goonewardena, Somaweera Chandrasiri W.A. Perera and George Perera were taken into custody by the police. By this period, the LSSP being the leading Marxist opposition party had organised trade unions. Paddy cultivators in the Hewagam Korale of the Colombo district too staged a strike against the government\'s arbitrary policy of purchasing paddy. The government paid paddy farmers Rs. 6 for a bushel. Later the price was increased to Rs 8 per bushel. Simultaneously the strike spread to the Kolonnawa Government Factory, the Department of Electrical Undertakings the Norton Bridge Power House – Electricity Supply Station, Bus companies, and the Colombo Gas Company. Around 20,000 employees had struck work. Sir John Kotelawala, Minister of Transport, Communications and Public Works rode rough shod on the workers. He insisted that they should return to work and give up strike tactics. N.M. Perera was arrested when he came on a representation to meet the acting Governor General Sir John Howard, the Chief Justice performing duties in that capacity. In protest against the detention of N.M. Perera strikes spread to the Leather Corporation, Glass Company and South-Western Bus Company. A meeting of trade unions was held at the Galle Face Green. A noteworthy feature of that assembly was the presence of pro-socialist Buddhist priests with radical ideologies for social justice. The striking speeches made at the Galle Face Green meeting resulted in the massive general strike and demonstrations. The demonstrators began their trek to Dematagoda starting from the Galle Face via, Darley Road Maradana on its way to the venue of the industrial employees meeting. The police opened fire resulting in the death of Kandasamy. STANLEY E. ABEYNAYAKE [Tribute] Rev. Fr. Bonnie Fernandopulle: Good Shepherd leaving flock Father Bonnie Fernandopulle is an extraordinary man. I met him 14 years ago when he came as the Head of St. Sebastian’s College, Moratuwa. The grass then on the cricket ground was patchy and dusty with neglect. A sore sight for sure. That I remember well. There is no need for me to give a ‘ball by ball’ description of the rest of the school. Somethings are best left unsaid. It certainly was a time when St. Sebastian’s, Moratuwa was drifting in the doldrums and sadly without a rudder. That is what Father Bonnie inherited. What Bonnie \'Suwami\' did to my old school is easy to describe. He did everything. If Herod re-built the Temple of Jerusalem, Father Bonnie re-built St. Sebastian’s College. The ‘born again’ school today stands proud and pristine, a beacon of knowledge and discipline, educating its 3,500 students by a team of dedicated teachers led by Father Bonnie. All the classrooms are well-maintained and many a new building is ‘Bonnie built.’ The sports teams achieve excellent results and the college choir pole-vaulted to prominence becoming a leading singing group in the whole country. The old boys come back, class of this year and class of that year, all gathering to take responsibility to help Father Bonnie in his many splendorous projects to upgrade their Alma Mater. Keeping with traditions of religion, prime place was given to worship with a new and spacious chapel that stands in the middle of the school premises. Of course the grass on the ground now is a perfect carpet of emerald green. The Irish-coloured college flag hoisted aloft announces to the world that St. Sebastian’s is totally restored to its former glory and certainly gone past the benchmarks that were established in its past heyday. A 25-metre pool stands in a corner. It was a joint project with CandleAid Lanka, an organisation I am associated with. I worked very closely with Father Bonnie on matters connected to the pool and its construction and operation. No, we never had tea and cakes, we just got the job done. He was a man of his word and had the vision to move forward and a scissor to cut the red tape. Had I not the deepest respect for him, I would not be writing this appreciation. Then comes the sad question. Why send him away from the haven he created when he has only two more years to serve? If it was to help another deserving school that would be logical. But the fairy tale here is different. Father Bonnie is transferred to Dehiwela as a Parish Priest. The best cricketer in the team is ordered in his final years to go and play soccer. The winning combination is changed and I have no idea why such things happen; maybe the powers that handle these matters do have their reasons. I do not know. I am like Zacchaeus looking from the Sycamore Tree merely observing and making a comment. The question here is who loses? Not Father Bonnie; certainly not him as he has more than made his mark and walks very tall in the minds of all and sundry connected to St. Sebastian’s College. The sad reality of his departure will be to the school and the 3,500 students who were striding to excellence under Father Bonnie’s guidance and discipline. Every year parents scramble to get their children to St. Sebastian’s. That was not for the song, but for the Singer. Yes, St. Sebastian’s College was ‘Bonnie Suwami’, a tough man of soft words and great deeds of education that stood out to prove his unblemished credentials. Was there any objection to Father Bonnie’s continued stay at St. Sebastian’s? No, I do not think so. The OBA, the PTA and the teachers and most importantly the 3,500 students only wanted the ‘Good Shepherd’ to mind the flock till his retirement. Then one must ask why this excellent educationalist is moving away to run a parish? I do not think there is any conspiracy here except the rules and rituals of governance of the Catholic Church. I am well aware that what I write is totally insignificant in the transfer of Father Bonnie. But somehow I feel that the ecumenical infallible eminence of the Church could have extended to Father Bonnie the courtesy of spending his two final years before retirement at St. Sebastian’s. Such tinkering of the scales of rules and regulations of the church certainly would have benefitted the 3,500 students along with the hopes of their parents. When across the Lunawa Lake the Principal of Prince of Wales College was transferred, the old boys and the parents went on a vehement protest campaign for weeks and stopped the traffic on the Galle Road. That was a hue and cry that reached the highest echelons of power in the country. It would be different at St. Sebastian’s. Father Bonnie would have none of that. He himself had ensured the transition is silent. So now it is “Bonnio Marks, Get Set and Go”. That is the order that came from the hierarchy. There will be no objections by vociferous students incited by the Old Boys or placard protesting parents and teachers writing petitions to keep Father Bonnie back. That is simply due to the respect they all hold for the church they worship. But somehow, one cannot deny the fact that the ‘Good Shepherd’ belongs to his St. Sebastian’s flock. Bonnie Suwami has two years to go. How wonderful it would be if the powers that be in coloured robes let him play his cricket at Moratuwa and not transfer him to kick footballs in Dehiwela? And we do need the grass to be emerald green in the playing field? CAPT. ELMO JAYAWARDENA ',No

'Palestinian envoy dies after \'accidental\' Prague blast','CZECH REPUBLIC: The Palestinian ambassador to the Czech Republic died on Wednesday after a blast at his Prague residence that police said was an accident. The blast was likely caused by an anti-theft system on the door of a safe that Jamal al-Jamal was opening at the time, Prague police said. The 56-year-old suffered \"very serious injuries\" in the blast and was taken to Prague\'s military hospital in an artificial coma, said Jirina Ernestova, spokeswoman for the emergency services. Police later confirmed that he had died. \"The evidence the police has doesn\'t suggest anything like a terror attack or that a specific person would set up a system with the intention to hurt or kill anyone,\" police spokeswoman Andrea Zoulova told AFP. Daniel Langer, surgeon at the Prague military hospital to which Jamal was taken, told Czech television the ambassador had suffered devastating \"head, belly and chest injuries following an explosion.\" Jamal, who took office in October, had only recently moved to the new residence on the northern outskirts of Prague. Palestinian foreign minister Riyad al-Malki hailed him as \"an exemplary diplomat, who served his country and cause well.\" The Palestinian foreign ministry said the blast occurred on Wednesday morning as Jamal \"was opening an old safe which had been brought from the previous embassy (building) to the new one.\" \"Minutes after opening the safe the explosion took place, causing serious injury to Jamal who was taken to hospital and operated on,\" the ministry said in a statement. Zoulova said police were not ruling out the possibility the safe was \"mishandled\", adding \"the victim has died so it will be harder to prove the cause.\" Police searched a building next door which also belongs to the Palestinian embassy, but said they had not found any other explosives in the area. \"Still, this (explosives) is a thing you shouldn\'t find at any embassy and we will continue a probe into this within the investigation,\" Czech police chief Martin Cervicek told the private Nova television station.

'ON THE LOOSE …','The absolute envious idiocy of some of the anti Rajapaksa banshee herd is reaching truly bizarre levels of incidence. One columnist who goes under name and style of Thisaranee Gunasekera must be congenitally prone to periodic bouts of lunacy and is in need of a thorough psychiatric evaluation for her own sake! She is truly hilarious however, and some of us particularly on slow news days are deeply indebted to her likes for offering us much needed relief and also for gifting us a story on a platter -- the new and more hilarious nadirs that the anti-Rajapaksa flower-child brigade plunges to, each passing day. This time this palpable simpleton, doing her best to pass off for an intellectual, footnotes end-quotes and all scholarly accoutrements included in her wee scribbles, writes excessive use of fertilizer by farmers/cultivators in the North Central Province and the farming sector is an indication of the Rajapaksa administration’s war on environment, or words to that effect. The irony is excruciating; the fact is that the Rajapaksa government made fertilizer affordable and accessible to all farmers -- and that was one of the primary policy planks of the Mahinda Chinthana program. The cultivators did not know how to handle the new bounty that had come their way, and as they say, the kids that get their hands in the candy jar, or the monkeys that get their hands on the deli pihiya (improvised razor blade …) are alike -- they do not know how to put something useful to harmless use. The cultivators used fertilizer in excessive quantities but this was as a result of good policy, a consequence of the Rajapaksa government’s empathy for the farmer who had had his fertilizer requirement thoroughly ignored by former administrations. The President was the first to admit that there is a problem with the excessive use of fertilizer in the farming hinterland, and this was stated emphatically in a speech made recently when land deeds were distributed among the farming community. That the government is being called a Nazi outfit for being on the side of the peasant farmer is so rich in irony that one is at a loss for words -- the position so beggars belief that it is difficult to decide whether the writer ought to seek institutionalization, or should be given a regular day job as a court jester. But as if the giggle inducing position on the fertilizer issue is not bizarre enough, this same writer then goes onto state that the recent stage collapse at the Hilton Hotel on New Year’s day is somehow traceable to the Nazi policy of the Rajapaksas. One needs to read that tract to believe it; it boggles the mind -- the battiness of the claim and of course the liberties taken with grammar, syntax and usage of figurative speech. One question is imperative -- ‘what was the lady on’ before she wrote the piece; the answer might lead the rest of us also into the nirvana of blissful ignorance that she seems to be so clearly addicted to. The central claim made is that the stage collapsed, and that somehow the fact that the workers at the hotel concerned looked the other way after the platform gave way is symptomatic of Rajapaksa Nazism! The stage collapse itself is also traced to the same kind of Hitlerite policy, and in case the reader is rubbing his eyes now please hold the disbelief as this is the verbatim quote: ‘This is a disaster unprecedented in the history of New Year celebrations in Colombo hotels. The bombastic creation and spontaneous deconstruction of this faux ‘Wonderland’ are symbolic and symbiotic of the Rajapaksa ethos of criminal negligence of quality and suicidal indifference to consequences’. A participant complained online that the Hilton staff did nothing to help the injured revelers. Helping even a stranger used to be a Lankan characteristic. Not anymore. During the last stages of the war, pitilessness towards the ‘inimical Other’ was turned into a patriotic virtue by the Rajapaksas. For the minor employees of Hilton, those young revelers capable of spending Rs.13,000/- for a VIP ticket would have seemed alien, perhaps inimical, and thus – as per the dominant Rajapaksa ethos – undeserving of even ordinary kindness.’ So the Rajapaksa government which had absolutely NOTHING WHATSOEVER to do with a potty little five star hotel celebration, is responsible for all the consequences of a stage collapse? Somebody, call for the doctors in Mulleriyawa, and do it fast. In other countries, the insane are not let loose for their own good. (While looking for that physician, please also look up the meaning of ‘symptomatic and SYMBIOTIC OF.’ Patient’s symptoms, in addition to acute mental distress, seem to indicate persistent and incurable verbal incontinence …) ',No
'Haye set to fight on despite doctors\' warnings','As everyone expected, it doesn’t look like former heavyweight champion David Haye (26-2) has any solid plans to retire despite apparently being advised to do so by specialists after undergoing surprise shoulder surgery late last year. Haye posted a picture of himself back in training on Twitter on Thursday, and said: \"First session of the year. 2014 is going to be my healthiest, let\'s start as we mean to go on\". Haye last fought in May 2012, coming out of ‘retirement’ to record a fifth round stoppage of Dereck Chisora at Upton Park. Since then, he has been scheduled to fight Lebanese Manuel Charr in June, only to pull out with an injured left hand, and subsequently announce a PPV ‘Battle of Britain’ fight with Tyson Fury for September. The Bermondsey heavyweight was then forced to cancel after suffering a deep cut above the eye in sparring one week beforehand, revealed via a picture he posted on Twitter. The Fury clash was then rescheduled for February 8 this year, only for Haye to undergo surprise shoulder surgery in November, posting pictures of himself in a hospital bed and wearing an elaborate looking shoulder sling. According to the press release issued by Hayemaker Boxing, Haye was advised to retire by his surgeon. At the time, Haye said: “Perhaps it just wasn\'t meant to be. The boxing gods keep hinting that maybe enough is enough and that it\'s time to finally hang up my gloves.” “I genuinely believed the shoulder injury wasn\'t that bad. But the doctor sent me for a detailed MRI scan and within 24 hours I was told the full extent of the damage. Twenty-four hours after that I was in the operating theatre.” Despite earning huge amounts of money from boxing, it seems that the opportunity to repair a legacy tainted somewhat by a thoroughly disappointing performance against Wladimir Klitschko is what keeps Haye going. His inability to cause the younger brother any kind of problem in their heavyweight unification fight was attributed afterwards to a dodgy looking little toe, for which Haye received pain numbing injections just before the fight. To me, it looked as if these injections affected his balance, as he appeared unable to get any decent shots off and slumped to the canvas several times under the weight of the Ukrainian champion. When Haye, referred to recently by Livefight as a ‘master of public relations’, displayed his toe to the world’s press after the fight, he was ridiculed in what was actually a public relations disaster. It is widely believed that the poor show, as well as a previous one-sided victory over former Olympic gold medalist Audley Harrision, brought about a temporary end to Pay Per View boxing on SKY - resurrected by the Carl Froch v Mikkel Kessler fight last year.

'BLAH! Billboard blues','Surrounded by concrete buildings, amid the hustle and bustle and beeping horns in the city, you wish to ease your mind by gazing at the sky. You search desperately for a bird roaming freely in the sky or green trees towering above the constructions. Alas, all you can see is fantasy scattered on boards via letters and images. Yes, boards of all kinds: advertisements, notices and propaganda – they obstruct your view. Faces grin at you without invitation or products are thrust in your face from afar. Profiles of overly made up men and women dressed in stylish attire and looking aloof, leer down at you as they clutch an accessory or an equally snobbish-looking cat or dog. Some boards even go as far as to display skimpily clad ‘ladies’ looking on suggestively. Some others announce news of an upcoming production which will hit local theatres or cinema halls soon or details of renowned teaching experts who will help your child to ace the upcoming examinations. Visual pollution It is visual pollution, trash in the sky and rubbish on boards. Today, they have even reached skyscraper heights. It seems that there is no limit to these giant billboards and cutouts. They not only block the view but also create safety hazards in the metropolis. Nothing destroys the little heaven of natural beauty left in cities more than the uncontrolled installation of signs and billboards. Drive across every city in the country -- lo and behold! -- these advertising boards have become a common sight. They irritate your eyes. Some offer bargains and products which might be of interest to certain groups but for nature-loving eyes, vivid colours, mega sized images, fonts and signs are tiring to look at. They even take away the grandeur of some of the historic buildings which stand tall on their age-old foundation and preserved as a part of our heritage. Those of us who grew up in the village yearn to see natural splendour. Artificial billboards which are technologically embellished in colours and features only add to the stress of the day. Natural disorder  It is said that wise choices and untouched scenic vistas are necessary to upgrade the quality of our lifestyle. Both aspects boost the confidence in human beings and motivates them to appreciate nature\'s beauty. Place a billboard at the entrance of the city park or in the middle of a grassy roundabout adorned in flowerbeds and witness how it damages the whole outlook. Every new billboard which is set up in town reflects the ugly side of the development process. It indirectly highlights the society\'s progress through destroying the natural beauty that Mother Nature has gifted upon us. This destructive sight serves only a handful of people who profit through business deals. It compels us to accept the destruction which befalls upon nature. The billboard hazard is ‘anti aesthetic’. They contribute to environmental disorder and create visual confusion. Critics have even argued that they are a distraction for drivers. Surveys have revealed that drivers tend to look at electronic billboards more than focus on the traffic lights. Because of the opposition based on safety and aesthetic concerns, digital billboards haven’t gotten a widespread market foothold. The outdoor advertising industry would love to see more digital billboards, because they offer greatly expanded sales opportunities. However, the public thinks otherwise. Here we bring you the views of some people who addressed this subject. Public opinion “I travel to Kandy often for business purposes. Billboards are something I dislike. I have been frequently travelling for a long span and I have noticed that day by day the number of billboards and different types of cut outs is increasing. They obviously destroy the natural look of every place. I honestly say it is a visual disturbance and I hate to see the same board repeatedly,” voiced a businessman. A youth adds, “Yes, it is clearly visual pollution. It is especially difficult to drive in the night amid these huge glittering multi coloured boards. Some of them are reflective with blinking lights. It is hard to bear and sometimes difficult to concentrate on driving. It decreases our visibility and attention. Sometimes we even miss actual signboards what we need to see because the billboards are so distracting. This causes road accidents.” Another youth questions whether there is any authority to control the billboards. He notes, “I wonder why they cannot do something to remove or minimize them. All these boards make the city a messy and ugly place. We should get rid of this menace first to become a developed country.” Responsible body Though almost every person says it is a nuisance, the issue remains with more boards and posters being planted across the isle day by day. Are there any regulations for these advertisements and notices? The \'Daily News\' contacted the responsible body, the Urban Development Authority (UDA). The UDA confirms that there are rules and regulations regarding billboards. Every person who wants to display a billboard, cutout or any type of poster must get the clearance certificate from the UDA Enforcement Division. It is also necessary to present a project proposal in which the size of the board is clearly mentioned. It is checked by the UDA before issuing the clearance certificate. It is possible for the UDA to remove unauthorized billboards. This is especially done when someone complains about a billboard which they find disturbing. According to the UDA, the drawback of their project is that there is no proper body to monitor the boards continuously. Therefore people seize this opportunity to display many boards and notices. Notably however, within the area of expressways such as Southern Expressway, Colombo – Katunayaka Expressway and Outer Circular Highway, it is strictly prohibited to display any type of advertising board except the authorized signboards owned by the Road Development Authority. According to the National Thoroughfares Act No 40 of 2008, Road Development authority (RDA) “every person, without either the prior consent of the Executive Engineer or without reasonable excuse, paints or inscribes or affixes or any picture, letter sign, statue, hoarding or other mark upon the carriageway of a road, a public road or national highway are not allowed and can be guilty of an offense...” The Act also states that the particular Executive Engineer has the authority to notify the owner or occupier of any building and require him to remove or alter any unauthorized porch, projecting roof, projecting window, step, wall, gate or any such thing and which has been erected or placed in front of a building which causes an obstruction to the safe passage of vehicles and pedestrians along a road, public road or the national highway. Any person, who fails to follow such a notice within reasonable time, will be guilty of an offense. “No person is allowed to place or fix any traffic sign, overhead beam, pipe, cable, wire gantries hoardings, rail or other similar apparatus over, along or across a road, a public road or national highway without the consent of the relevant Executive Engineer…” the Act further states. Going green Nobody can display a board on their own will. What everybody requires is not cities without boards, but cities with a limited number of attractive, eco friendly, billboards. This trend is quickly catching up abroad. As big brands become more environmentally conscious, green advertising is steadily increasing in an attempt to court new generations of eco-savvy consumers. Lush gardens, solar and wind-powered displays, and other \'living\' signs have been transformed from otherwise obnoxious ad clutter into attention-grabbing and ingenious eco statements. For example, a beverage company billboard displays Fukien tea plants scattered across a 60-foot canvas absorbing 13 pounds of carbon dioxide annually (46,800 pounds total). The entire billboard is made from eco-friendly materials. Right down to the beverage bottles, the plants rest in the soil made from organic fertilizers. An irrigation system keeps things fresh and watered. Another billboard belonging to a restaurant outlet had grown a lettuce garden to promote their salads and healthy menu. In Lima, Peru, residents who suffer from a lack of drinkable water have the University of Engineering and Technology (UTEC) to thank for a water-producing billboard. The sign takes moisture from the air — high humidity aids the process since Lima’s rainfall numbers are low — and converts it into filtered drinking water. A tap at the base of the billboard offers up to 25 gallons of water per day for residents. Since it was installed in December last year, the billboard has produced 2,496 gallons of potable water. The motto in Dubai seems to be bigger is better — at least when it comes to a biodegradable billboard made from eco-friendly inks and materials, right down to the framework. The billboard took seven hours to assemble and stretches over 3,000 feet long. The advert won a spot in the Guinness Book of World Records. Love it or hate it, advertising has been an intrinsic part of our modern life. Some companies and individuals have proved that green advertising is possible. All you need is the right mindset and a little bit of creativity to make things possible. So make an effort to look better in the public eye. Green up the urban landscapes!

'Body washes ashore at Galle Face: woman was mentally unsound','Pettah Police yesterday told the City Coroner that the woman whose body was found in the sea opposite the Old Parliament on Saturday was that of an unmarried woman, a resident of Kadawatha. City Coroner Ashroff Rumy held the inquest on the death of Malavi Herath Mudiyanselage Deepika Nilanthi, 43.

She used to visit Galle Face and walked on the green eating an ice cream. On the day of the incident she left home around 11.00 a.m. Since she normally returns at about 6.00 p.m. and had not returned, I lodged a complaint with Kadawatha Police,\" Herath said.

'Frozen :  Tale that will make you melt !','Beautiful visuals, melodious sound tracks, mesmerizing characters and a heartwarming story... These are some of the terms which best describes Chris Buck and Jennifer Lee’s ‘Frozen,’ an animated musical Disney-princess flick of a different tune. An omen Based on the popular Hans Christian Anderson fable ‘The Snow Queen,’ ‘Frozen’ tells the story of Elsa, a princess from the land of Arendelle endowed with inexplicable, ice-emitting powers. Though her magic seems like a plus point at first it gets out of hand. She accidentally injures her sister Anna in childhood. In a desperate attempt to save Anna, Elsa’s parents ride off into the woods to find trolls who resemble stones. The trolls note that Elsa has luckily struck Anna on the head. If her powers had struck Anna’s heart things would have been deadly. While curing Anna they also question if Elsa had been “born” or “cursed” with magical powers. This seems like an omen of what is to come in the future. After wiping Anna’s memory of what took place in the day the king and queen decide to keep Elsa under lock and key. She is taught to “conceal, don’t feel.” This is one of the themes of being suppressed which runs throughout the movie. With the untimely demise of her parents a grown up Anna dreams of a day when the palace gates are opened to the public, when she does not have to interact with her sister behind closed doors and of falling in love. She achieves all three on her sister’s coronation day. Her story could have ended happily ever after but the tale takes an unexpected turn when Elsa’s secret is revealed. Novel fashion  Olaf  Fleeing from the kingdom Elsa reaches a mountaintop and builds herself an ice palace. She is unaware that she had left Arendelle in an eternal winter. Anna engages in a quest to put things right between her and Elsa and save Arendelle from doom. The film’s empowering themes of feminine strengths and bonds eventually flourish in novel fashion. Though men are present in the tale they do not provide the key to the problems in the movie. The action does not idle and every aspect show on screen seems to be relevant to the story. Not once do you feel it is gimmicky or out of place. Even the musical sequences are full of interesting displays. One fine example is Elsa’s ballad of freedom where she experiments with her powers. These scenes also create doubts in our mind if Elsa is actually the stereotyped evil Snow Queen or the magnanimous one which the story projects to us from the beginning. Fits of giggles One of the film’s best features is in how much attention has gone into the detailing of the visuals. Elsa’s ice palace itself has given ‘Frozen’s animators a workout. Though a bulk of the tale displays winter and darkness there are enough vibrant shades brought in many other forms to make it a visual treat for the young and old. The voice cast is superb. They lend emotions to their voices. Kristen Bell and Idina Menzel do a splendid job as sisters and bring diversity to their roles. Josh Gad as the dorky snow man gives a stand out performance. ‘Frozen’ also works because of its music and catchy tunes. The emotional scenes bring tears to our eyes and the comic episodes have us in fits of giggles. The goings-on of Anna and Kristoff’s quest are fresh and funny, particularly when they come across Olaf, a Mr. Potato Head-like buck-toothed snowman with an endearing, blissfully ignorant hankering for summer. The ending too is not what you would expect. Moving away from the much exhausted fairytale climax in which the love of a handsome prince would save the heroine, ‘Frozen’ focuses more on individual strengths and family ties. ‘Tangled’ had been dubbed as a success and enjoyable family movie by critics. ‘Frozen,’ made by the same team, is even better. Unlike its title, ‘Frozen’ will certainly warm you up ! ',No

'\'American Hustle,\' \'12 Years a Slave\' top Golden Globes','US: Harrowing drama \"12 Years a Slave\" won the coveted best drama Golden Globe on Sunday, while crime caper \"American Hustle\" won the musical/comedy film prize and two acting awards. Hollywood turned out in their fashion finest for the 71st annual Golden Globes, Tinseltown\'s biggest honours fest before the Academy Awards in March -- and a key indicator as to who could be tipped to take home Oscars. Australian Cate Blanchett won best drama actress for Woody Allen\'s \"Blue Jasmine\" and Matthew McConaughey triumphed for best drama actor in \"Dallas Buyers Club.\" \"The Wolf of Wall Street\" star Leonardo DiCaprio and Amy Adams from \"American Hustle\" won the equivalent awards in the musical/comedy category.

'Minister to provide artificial leg, job for Lankan worker injured in Saudi','Foreign Employment Promotion and Welfare Minister Dilan Perera offered to provide an artificial leg and employment in Colombo to the Lankan worker who lost his leg while working in Saudi Arabia. The minister was in Saudi Arabia to sign an agreement with Saudi Labour Minister Adel-Al- Fakeih for the protection of Lankan workers in the Kingdom. Ruwan Chamara Herath, 29, suffered a serious accident while driving a vehicle without headlights. He claimed his sponsor forced him to drive the vehicle at midnight even though he knew that the headlights were not working . On an intervention by the Lankan consulate, the expat who lost his leg, left the Kingdom with an enhanced amount of SR 25,000. On a complaint made to the Sri Lankan consulate in Jeddah, Herath said the sponsor wanted to forcibly repatriate him against his wishes without giving proper compensation. “The SR 5,000 which the sponsor has promised is my three months’ wages and allowances,” he said. Speaking to the Daily News, the minister said Herath deserves the fullest support from the government. He had come here to help his family but unfortunately, he had to return home because of this accident, Perera said,adding that the government would always look after such interests. A senior official from the consulate said the mission had to raise the compensation to SR 25,000 with the sponsor who tried to send the victim with a paltry SR 5,000 as compensation. “We are happy that we worked out a reasonable compensation on a mutual agreement between the sponsor and the employee. He added that the sponsor had to pay suitable compensation to the worker since the person had met with the accident while on duty. Herath claimed that the company he worked treats its workers like slaves without proper regard for local labor regulations. He said he had to do 20 trips a day transporting sand in huge trucks for a cement factory, along with 16 other Sri Lankan drivers. He said he came to the Kingdom to earn money to build his dream house on a plot of land he owns in Gampaha. He said an artificial leg would cost him money equivalent to SR 8,000 in Sri Lanka. He said he has no definite plans of his future but he is confident that some philanthropists and the Sri Lankan government would help him. Prior to his departure, Herath was hosted at the consulate for three days. “We gave him all the support and cooperation for him to return home,” he said , adding that the Sri Lankan Bureau of Foreign Employment (SLBFE),would also extend its services to rehabilitate him in his hometown. The SLBFE is a statutory body which looks after the interests of overseas workers. Sri Lankans who go abroad are expected to register themselves with the bureau and it maintains a complete data of all registrants to offer them services as an when required. There are around 550,000 Sri Lankans working in the Kingdom ,which is the largest concentration of the island’s workers in the Middle East. The visiting minister also visited the safe houses of the Sri Lankan missions in Riyadh and Jeddah and listened to the grievances of the runaway maids who sought shelter at the missions. Minister Perera said that the complaints from the housemaids working in the Kingdom are minimal compared to the Lankan worker population in Saudi Arabia. The Riyadh embassy receives an average of 10 runaway maids ,while its consulate in Jeddah gets around three cases a day.  ',No
'Police compensation','The Sri Lankan Police department is considering compensating the victims of unlawful arrests or those wounded in Police custody. It\'s good news. But how far can the public afford the mistakes of the Police? There will be a claim every other day. The United Kingdom is no stranger to the compensating culture. Every year millions of pounds are being awarded to victims of unlawful arrests or Police brutality. The Metropolitan Police has spent £9 million in the past six years to settle complaints over Police actions. Last year alone, the Police have investigated 6,603 complaints against the service. The figures, obtained under the Freedom of Information Act show that in 2010-11, the Met paid £1.1m in 72 settled civil actions; almost £600,000 in 128 settled threatened actions and £48,000 in five court awards. It is almost similar to the figures paid in 2009-10 on settled and civil actions. A lawyer received £100,000 and an apology from the Police after his wrongful arrest in 2009. He went into a diabetic coma when an officer took his insulin following the arrest in London. The £100,000 compensation was donated to charity. He had been arrested outside the High Court in London after officers mistakenly thought he was a protester who was breaking the law. The compensation scheme is working with difficulties determining the truth with loads of false claims. Recently, a Metropolitan Police spokesperson said: \"Nothing will change until there is an effective Police complaints system and until officers are ready to give evidence against colleagues who are guilty of misconduct. It is important that people have faith in our investigation process and we would encourage anyone who feels we have fallen below the standards expected of us to make a complaint which will be investigated.\" Once named \"the best Police force in the world,\" now have behavioural problems among its officers. Although the Police are there to protect us they are also humans. They also make mistakes. But until you are wrongfully arrested or accused, you will never feel the real pain of an innocent person. Some Police officers misuse their power or use excessive force when dealing with situations. In England, it is rare to see a Police officer with a baton. But some of them are equipped with Taser guns to make the accused paralysed if he or she is being difficult. Taser guns come in different forms mainly as a gun and a baton. It gives a temporary high-voltage low-current electrical discharge to override the body\'s muscle-triggering mechanisms. The recipient is immobilised via two metal probes connected via wires to the electroshock device. The recipient feels pain, and can be momentarily paralysed while an electric current is being applied. There were instances where it had been used unnecessarily making the victims suffer an unpleasant electric shock. Although the London Police officers try to behave decently as much as possible, there are instances of innocent people being shot dead on the spot. Incidents when a person got shot when he walked with a wooden table leg underneath his overcoat and an immigrant who was shot point blank on an underground train when he tried to runaway when he saw some officers are unforgettable incidents in Police history. The recent London riots ignited as a result of an unarmed black person being killed by the Police suspecting him of carrying firearms. Yes, the Police make mistakes. But the compensation of victims has to be borne by the public. There is no personal loss to the officer unless he is sacked or suspended. It is good that a Police compensation scheme is to be established in Sri Lanka. In the UK, people are more aware of the social compensation schemes and there are organisations and companies who make it easy for the victims. However, I doubt how the citizens are going to make use of it. Here I have to mention the motor insurance in Sri Lanka. A majority of Sri Lankan drivers do not properly understand motorcar insurance policies. Most of the time, they try to settle accidents by paying compensation to the affected party from their own pocket. Most of them are not aware that it is the obligation of the insurance company to pay on the driver\'s behalf even when the accident is fatal. There is no doubt that the motor insurance industry in Sri Lanka is laughing at the motorists who are settling from their own pockets. Therefore, in a situation like that, it is very important to make people knowledgeable on making a claim against the Police department. Before that, the legal professionals should be prepared to advise the victims honestly and correctly. In England, the legal fees of a compensated client is being paid by the authorities. Not the victim. He has the right to keep the full compensation for himself. Therefore, lawyers should make claimants aware of the fee structure before taking up a matter. It is important to note that victims of the Police department are not only the people arrested and harassed wrongfully, but also the people who are affected by criminals not being arrested. ',No

'[ESSENCE – (21-01-2014)]','Games you need to play In 2014 - Part One It’s been nearly two months since the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One were launched and gamers are ready to finally move on from the first batch of games that launched with their systems.  Destiny  While there were few stand-out titles in that bunch, the release line-up for 2014 is totally different story. The original creators of both “Call of Duty” and “Halo” are working on brand new properties that are each experimenting with their own combinations of multiplayer and story aspects. The number of reasons to be excited for 2014 is seemingly endless. That’s why we’ve gone through the major releases for the year to select some games you simply can’t miss. “Titanfall” Release date: March 2014 Available for: Xbox One, Xbox 360, PC Why to play it: From the original developers of “Call of Duty” and the publishers of “Battlefield” comes a fast-paced first-person shooter where every player has a jetpack and can summon a mech. It’s like adrenaline on a Blu Ray disc. “The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt” Release date: TBA 2014 Available for: PC, PS4, Xbox One Why to play it: The “Witcher” games have always had morally gray, complex stories, kind of like HBO’s “Game of Thrones,” except that your choices affect the outcomes. With the move to next-gen consoles, the series’ developers promise that they’ll be able to bring that level of moral ambiguity to an open world environment.   Titanfall  The Walking Dead: Season 2 Release date: Dec 2013 (episode 1), TBA 2014 for future episodes Available for: PC, Mac, PS3, Xbox 360, iOS, PS Vita, Ouya Why to play it: The first season on “The Walking Dead” proved to be an emotional adventure that made you care about its characters before throwing them into terrible situations that made you make decisions that felt like they made an impact. “Metal Gear Solid V: Ground Zeroes” Release date: March 28, 2014 Available for: PS3, PS4, Xbox One, Xbox 360 Why to play it: While it isn’t the complete “Metal Gear Solid V” experience, “Ground Zeroes” will give players their first real look at the game and Kiefer Sutherland as the new voice actor for the series’ hero, Snake. “Tom Clancy’s The Division” Release date: Late 2014 Available for: PS4, Xbox One, PC Why to play it: “The Division” will combine third-person shooting with an open world set in New York City to make one of the most interesting new multiplayer shooters in some time.

No longer limited to the Xbox, Bungie is in a good position to upend “Call of Duty” as the must-play shooter on every major console this fall.

A definitive guide to reheating leftovers Leftovers: the same food you had last night, except a little grosser!Well, it doesn’t have to be that way. Strategically choosing the stovetop over the microwave could reinvigorate countless pizza slices. And microwaving your rice the right way could make leftover Chinese food a lot more appetizing. Learn how to reheat almost everything languishing on those refrigerator shelves. *Pizza: Microwaved pizza is the worst. The crust gets hard and awful while the rest of it becomes squishy and wet. No longer! Heat up slices in a covered skillet for crisp rather than soggy slices. *Rice: You know how rice gets hard and brittle after a few hours in the fridge? It’s the worst. But here’s a simple trick: Place the rice in a microwave-safe bowl, cover it completely with a damp paper towel, and zap it for a few minutes. Voila! Your rice is soft again! *Roast Vegetables: According to the The New York Times, hearty veggies like kale, root vegetables, and chard should be popped in the oven for up to 30 minutes, covered, at 350 degrees. Want to add some caramelization to foods like broccoli, brussels sprouts, and cauliflower? Let them hang out under the broiler for a few minutes. *Soup: A thick soup will splatter if you reheat it, uncovered, in a microwave. If you don’t want your microwave looking like this, cover or reheat it on your stovetop. It’s a simple trick, but it’s one we’ve forgotten WAY too many times. * Fried Chicken: We’ll be honest with you, folks-fried chicken is never going to be as good as it was when it was fresh and piping-hot. That said, your best chance at a decent reprise meal is to wrap it in tin foil and throw it under the broiler for a few minutes. *French Fries: Remember the advice we gave you about fried chicken? We’re about to give it to you again. Hit the broiler, baby. *Macaroni and Cheese: If you reheat mac ‘n cheese in the microwave, you’ll get some crusty pieces, some overcooked pieces, and some pieces that never warmed up at all. Trust us; you’re way better off heating it up in a skillet on the stove. PopSugar has a few other good tips: Start off by melting a pat of butter or a bit of oil. After adding the pasta, pour in a couple tablespoons of milk. The result is creamier, evenly heated pasta. And no crusty bits! Go forth and reheat, readers. Just give that microwave a break once in a while. (Yahoo UK) ‘American Hustle’ wins top SAG award The actors have spoken - and without any writers scripting their lines - at the 20th annual Screen Actors Guild Awards. (That might account for Matthew McConaughey’s wild “Neptune” speech, or Cate Blanchett’s ramble.)  The American Hustle crew  With an “American Hustle” win for Outstanding Cast Performance in a Motion Picture, that movie has stepped over rival “12 Years a Slave” to become the frontrunner for Best Picture at the Oscars. The only movie in its path is “Gravity,” which is basically a two-hander with Sandra Bullock and George Clooney. Remember: Actors comprise the largest branch of the Academy. Tonight gave viewers a preview of the Academy Awards but it will not be a simple “American Hustle” sweep come Oscar night: While that movie won the ensemble award, no single member of the cast won an individual award. Now, clearly, there’s been a major shift in the Best Actor race: Matthew McConaughey of “Dallas Buyers Club” is in the lead, topping Bruce Dern and Chiwetel Ejiofor. And his co-star Jared Leto has dominated the Best Supporting Actor competition. As for Best Actress, there’s absolutely no surprise that Cate Blanchett, the actor’s actress, has maintained her frontrunner spot for “Blue Jasmine.” There’s a minor upset in the Best Supporting Actress category as the race between Lupita Nyong’o of “12 Years a Slave” and “American Hustle’s” Jennifer Lawrence just got a little tighter with Nyong’o’s win tonight. Last year the SAG picked “Argo,” which went on to sweep the Oscars - but it’s not entirely a crystal ball. Over the past decade, the Actors Guild missed with “The Help,” “Inglourious Basterds” and “Little Miss Sunshine,” none of which won Best Picture at the Academy Awards.

A new study found that what people perceive as a sixth sense may simply be their vision systems detecting changes they can’t articulate. “People can sense things that they believe they cannot see, such as changes in a person’s appearance,” said study co-author Piers Howe, a vision scientist at the University of Melbourne in Australia. “But this isn’t anything magical or a sixth sense; this can be explained in terms of known visual processing.” Sixth sense? Many people believe in the supernatural. In fact, one survey found that almost one-third of people believe in extrasensory perception and more than two-thirds reported a paranormal experience. While a few scientific studies have hinted that people can sense the future just before it happens, follow-up studies concluded these results were artifacts of statistics or flawed study design. Howe’s interest was piqued when a student came to him claiming she had a quasi-magical sixth sense. “She claimed that she could sense things that she couldn’t see,” such as when a friend was recently in an accident, Howe said. Howe was skeptical, so he and University of Melbourne psychology graduate student Margaret Webb decided to test this sense. Normal visual processing Webb had friends dress up to pose in a pair of pictures, with slight appearance changes. For instance, his friends would wear glasses in one photo but not in the other, or put on lipstick in one photo and not in the other. The team then showed 48 undergraduate students the first photo for 1.5 seconds, followed by a 1-second pause, before revealing the other photo. Participants then had to indicate if there were any differences between the photos and, if so, what those differences were. (The students could pick possible changes from a list.) Participants often accurately detected there were changes in the photos. But the students weren’t very good at identifying what had changed, even with big alterations, such as the removal of a large Mexican hat. The same phenomenon is at play when friends miss that new hairstyle or pair of glasses, or sense a change but can’t quite put their finger on it, Howe said. Howe suspected that the brain detected shifts in the visual metrics it uses to understand a scene - such as darkness, color, verticality or contrast - but that it didn’t translate to the person’s ability to verbalize what had changed. In a second experiment, the team showed students an array of red disks and green disks, and showed the array again with some of the disks randomly switched from one color to another. Once again, many people detected changes they couldn’t identify. But when the team changed the color of some disks, but not the total amount of red and green in all of the disks combined, this “sixth sense” went away. Die-hard believers The findings suggest the origin of the phenomenon in which a person seems to be intuitively aware of something that they don’t believe they have seen or sensed in another way is due to the perception of differences in these visual metrics, not a sense that operates outside the normal laws of physics. For instance, in the case of Howe’s student, she may have noticed tiny changes in his appearance (such as small cuts or a bandage), but not been consciously aware that she picked up on those cues. The study is unlikely to convince believers in the supernatural, Howe said. “I can present this evidence, but people who feel they have a sixth sense - they are just going to carry on believing it,” Howe said. “It’s a very compelling feeling that you have a sensing ability. And you do have a sensing ability - it’s just not magical.” (Yahoo UK) Chocolate chip cookies Makes 24 cookies 2 1/8 cups all-purpose flour 1 teaspoon baking soda 1/2 teaspoon salt 1 1/2 cups regular semisweet chocolate chips 1 cup large bittersweet chocolate chips 1 1/2 cups walnuts, finely chopped 1 cup (2 sticks) unsalted butter, room temperature 1 cup light or dark brown sugar, tightly packed 1/2 cup white sugar 2 eggs 2 teaspoons vanilla extract *Heat oven to 375 F. *Sift flour, baking soda, and salt. Set aside. *Mix together chocolate chips and chopped nuts. Set aside. *All medium speed unless otherwise noted: In a standing mixer, with the paddle attachment, cream the butter and sugars until well mixed and light. Scrape down the sides. Add one egg. Mix for 5 seconds. Scrape down the sides. Add second egg. Mix for 5 seconds. Scrape down the sides. Add vanilla. Mix for 5 seconds. Scrape down the sides. *You’re going to add the sifted flour mixture in 4 batches, stopping before adding the final batch. For the first 3 batches, mix at low speed just to combine, scraping down the sides between each addition. When you get to the final batch of flour, add the chocolate chip/nut mixture. They will get a bit crushed. That’s okay. Mix until there’s barely a trace of flour visible. Don’t over-mix. Sometimes, it’s better to be safe and do the final bit of mixing by hand. *Set up a sheet pan with a silpat or parchment paper. Bake one tray at a time or they will all cook at different rates. Make them spherical, not flat. The cookie size is up to you. I find the bigger they are, the better ratio you have between gooey interior and crisp exterior. 2 ounces is about right for that. *Leave a few inches between the raw cookies. Place sheet pan in the oven. They cook very fast at this temp. I never set a timer. I just hang around the oven and drink tea. They’re done when they’re brown and crispy on the outer border and raw in the very middle (8 to 10 minutes). Remove sheet pan. Allow to cool for a few minutes, then, with a spatula, transfer cookies to a cookie rack to cool. If you’re not going to eat them right away, they should be frozen. If you’re not baking them off right away, portion them out with an ice cream scoop, place them on a sheet pan, and freeze. Once firm, store them in a Ziploc bag. Works great to bake them off when they’re frozen. (Yahoo UK) ',No

Motor,'Kia Sorento awarded 5-Star safety rating by US Govt. agency The 2014 edition of the Kia Sorento which arrived in Sri Lanka in May 2013, has been awarded the 5-star safety rating by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) in the USA, the highest possible overall safety rating in that country.

'Legal Aid Commission','Litigation to settle disputes People resort to unaffordable litigation to settle disputes through the judicial process. Some poor people are reluctantly drawn before courts by the rich and the powerful to oppress them, through litigation and deny the basic human rights of the former, such as freedom, equality and rights to property. These powerful litigators use litigation as an instrument of oppression to harness the poor and the vulnerable. Their threatening motto is to say to the vulnerable “see you in courts”. Legal Aid litigation is different as it helps ordinary women, who are facing emotional and economic hardships when their husbands abandon them or become hapless accident victims who are compelled into submission by Insurance Companies or poor consumers who are cheated by producers, manufacturers and traders on a daily basis. The big supermarkets and mega malls are a law unto themselves despite the Consumer Protection Law No.9 of 2003 or the much publicized Consumer Court. We had a recent case where a young man had purchased a slab of chocolate and found a gecko imbedded. The manufacturer dared the victim to sue the giant Companies or alternately accept a few more free slabs of chocolate as a settlement. Effective consumer protection in Sri Lanka is yet unheard of. Under our Constitution, the violation of fundamental rights by definition is attributable to executive or administrative action of the state. Unlike in South Africa and a few other countries, the private sector is not liable for fundamental human rights violations in Sri Lanka. This continues to be a paradox. A detraction on the principle of equal access to justice to all with regard to human rights violations. The basic defender of the perpetrators (Executive and Administrative Officers) is the state law officers of the country. Critical views have been expressed by observers about the conflicting role of the AG, as the protector of the Sri Lankan Constitution but stepping into courts to defend alleged violators of the Constitutional provisions on fundamental rights. Proposals had been made that a separate department of the Attorney-General should defend alleged violators of FR provisions. The practice of the AG not appearing for alleged perpetrators of torture should also be noted in this context. The victims of fundamental rights violation are often very poor and powerless with inexperienced litigation lawyers pitted against the legal power of the state, which could be seen as oppression by litigation. It is in this context that legal aid to the poor need to be strengthened by a democratic state supported by the donor community and the Bar association of Sri Lanka. Appearing for clients in need of legal aid may not be glamorous but it is an essential public legal service. The BASL elects six volunteers to work as Legal Aid Commissioners but the LAC continues to be constrained by the lack of funds to carry out its mission to provide access to justice to all. In this situation oppression by litigation is likely to continue in Sri Lanka. - Legal Aid Commission [Questions and Answers] Elders’ maintenance Question : I am being neglected by my children who are doing well in the private sector.

His neighbour is always quarreling with him due to a dispute regarding the trees near the boundary fence. We made several complaints to the Grama Niladhari, but all to no avail. We don’t like to go to courts. I heard that the Mediation Board could resolve disputes of this nature. Is it correct? How could I reach the Mediation Board? Please advice me. - Rani, Koswaththa. Answer: Your matter can be referred to the Mediation Board. Mediation is a process of alternative dispute resolution in which a neutral third party, the Mediator, assists two or more parties in order to help them achieve an agreement with concrete effects, on a matter of common interest; any activity in which an agreement or whatever matter is researched by an impartial third party, usually a professional, in the common interest of the parties. The intervention into a dispute or negotiation of an acceptable, impartial and neutral third party who has no authoritative decision making power, to assist the contending parties to voluntarily to reach their own mutually acceptable settlement of issues in dispute. Under the Mediation Board Act No.72 of 1988 and its amendments, you can personally make an application to the Mediation Board. Your problem should be stated in brief. Your name and address together with the names and addresses of the party to the dispute should be mentioned. On receipt of your application, the Board will summon the parties for a discussion. The police could also refer you to the Mediation Board. This happens when a complaint is made to the police and when the police feel that matter should be resolved by Mediation or according to the Law; it has to be referred to Mediation. Passport for adopted child Question: I have decided to adopt a child in the near future . There is a adoption case at the Colombo District court.

'When they don’t know they are ill','Soon after his wife was diagnosed with frontotemporal dementia, Bill Floyd consulted a neurologist who had been a member of his church. People with this illness don’t know they have it, the doctor warned. They don’t understand that anything is wrong. This little-known yet common consequence of this kind of dementia, Alzheimer’s disease and other brain disorders is called anosognosia, and it leaves people unaware that they are compromised by illness. Imagine someone who survives a stroke and is paralyzed on the left side of his body, but is convinced he can walk without assistance. A less extreme example: Someone with moderate memory deficiency gets lost on the road or has accidents, but thinks she is driving just as well as ever. This is not denial, said Sandra Weintraub, a professor of psychiatry and neurology at Northwestern University. “It’s a lack of insight and awareness,” she said. “Everyone else around them is aware they’re not the same, and they are not.” Sometimes anosognosia is selective: An aging parent may realize she has a problem with one kind of activity but is oblivious to other difficulties. But in other cases, the lack of self-awareness is more extensive. According to some estimates, up to 42 percent of people with early Alzheimer’s disease have symptoms of anosognosia. And as dementia progresses, the symptoms also advance, evidence suggests. Trying to make someone with this problem understand that they have changed and need to accept new limits often is an exercise in frustration, Dr. Weintraub said. Reasoning and evidence make little difference to these patients. Brain studies suggest that the lack of awareness may be linked to the deterioration of the frontal lobes, especially on the right side, which play an important role in problem-solving, planning, and understanding the context and meaning of experiences and social interactions. Some studies also point to atrophy in the temporal lobes. “Really, as of yet, we have no idea what’s going on,” Dr. Weintraub said. Mr. Floyd, 70, a professional photographer in Evanston, Ill., spoke publicly about his experience as a caregiver at a conference on frontotemporal dementia sponsored by Northwestern University that I attended late last year. “My wife never ever acknowledged she had this disease, and to bring it up was painful,” he told the audience.

'Indonesia incursions like sports fumbles - Abbott','AUSTRALIA: Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott on Tuesday compared accidental naval incursions into Indonesian waters during asylum-seeker operations to dropping a catch in cricket and said Canberra\'s apologies had been accepted. Jakarta has vowed to step up navy patrols and called on Australia to suspend people-smuggling pushback operations after its vessels \"inadvertently\" entered Indonesian sovereign waters, renewing tensions between the neighbours. Abbott expressed his \"deep regret\" at the incidents and said Australia had \"fully apologised...and I think the Indonesians have accepted our apology.\" \"On the high seas all sorts of things happen, there are winds, there are tides, there are other things that they are focusing on,\" the prime minister said when asked how it was possible to accidentally stray into another country\'s waters. \"Even people who are at the very top of their game, even people who are the very best at their job will occasionally make mistakes. Test cricketers occasionally drop catches, great footballers occasionally miss tackles, and regretfully there were a couple of occasions when this mistake was made, but it won\'t happen again.\" He said that a key point to make was that it had been \"almost 40 days\" since a boat carrying would-be refugees had arrived in Australia. Indonesia condemned the violation of its territorial integrity by Australian vessels earlier this month as a \"serious matter in bilateral relations\" and called for the suspension of Abbott\'s military-led \"Operation Sovereign Borders\" turning back people-smuggling boats where it is safe to do so.

'Citizens’ Mail','Save the majestic pre-historic turtles Turtles have been in the news in the print and electronic media during the past few days. Turtles have been described as marine or freshwater reptiles of the order Chelonia, encased in a shell of bony plates and having flippers or webbed toes used in swimming. Newspapers highlighted the transfer of four albino turtles from a Turtle Hatchery in Kosgoda to the Dehiwala Zoo, following a court order. There was also news of instances of several turtles being slaughtered for meat. At Rosapaduwa in the Kalpitiya area, three persons had been fined by a Magistrate, for being in possession of 1,500 kgs of turtle meat. The beaches of Sri Lanka being a tropical island attract a variety of turtles. These slow yet graceful pre-historic creatures are mesmerizing and deserve all our respect. These \'marine warriors\' which have been roaming the oceans for millions of years migrate through the seas with grace. It is hard to believe that turtles only need to surface once every thirty minutes for a fresh air breath and when asleep they are able to stay under the surface the entire night – because they need so little oxygen. Marine turtles have a life span of 80 years and reach sexual maturity only after 30 years. Female turtles return to the beach they were hatched on to lay their own eggs. Each nest usually has between 80 to 120 eggs and a female turtle may nest up to five times a season. When the little turtles hatch they make their way in a frenzy, straight to the sea like little motorized water toys. However the sad fact is that on the average, 1,000 eggs laid will yield only a single mature adult turtle, for they easily become victims of predators. The coastal beaches of Kosgoda and Ahungalla especially, are nesting grounds to five species of turtles including the Green Turtle, Leatherback, Hawksbill, Loggerhead and Olive Ridley Turtle. They all have selected specific areas and continue to nest in their territories. It is correct that along the Southern coast there are several hatcheries which endeavour to protect turtles, their eggs and their way of life. Stricter laws should be implemented to further support the cause of saving turtles from poachers and predators. HARSHI NADIE PERERA\r\n PILIYANDALA Send two elephants not one It was reported in the press that during President Mahinda Rajapaksa\'s recent tour of Israel, he had expressed desire to gift an elephant to that country. Such gestures of goodwill to strengthen ties between friendly countries have been common and acceptable. However, sending a single elephant to Israel, if no other of the same species is found there, would not be very appropriate as elephants like humans too, feel lonely as time passes by. The psychological effect that an elephant would be subjected to as a result of being forced to live alone in a totally new environment, would be terrible. We have often read of heart-rending stories about such unfortunate elephants living under similar circumstances in some countries, languishing in zoos without a companion, undergoing much mental trauma. Therefore, I suggest that a pair of elephants should be selected to be sent to Israel, to fulfil the President\'s wish instead of one, if no other elephants are found there at the moment. Being more kind hearted to our innocent dumb friends is no doubt the essence of humanity. As our President is also very kind hearted, I am sure he too will agree to this suggestion whole heartedly. DHANAPALA NISSANKA\r\n ANURADHAPURA Ambalangoda town needs a sub-post office The Agency Post Office which was functioning in the heart of the Ambalangoda town for a number of years, closed down a few months back. The main Post Office of the town is located along the old Main Street away from the business area. A Sub Post Office is a necessity for the town as the main commercial area is now situated along the new Galle-Colombo main road where about twelve Banks carry out their business activities. Business institutions like Singer, Abans, Cargills Food City, Osu Sala, pharmacies, the main shopping complex of Ambalangoda, the Central Bus Station, the railway station and several other agencies such as the Telecom, are also located along this main road. A leading college in Ambalangoda with a student population of about three thousand or more, is also situated at one end of the new town area. This town area has a circulating population of about two thousand persons from about 8.30 am to 4.00 pm during all days of the week. Any person who has to buy stamps, make use of the local Telemail Service, send a money order, register a letter, send a parcel or get a phone call has to go to the main Post Office some distance away. The Postal Department should take early action to open a fully fledged Sub Post Office along the main Galle-Colombo highway in Ambalangoda without delay, as almost all commercial institutions function here. An Agency Post Office will not serve the full needs of the citizens of the town as they are not even authorised to issue money orders. LIONEL LEKAMWASAM LEANAGE JP\r\n AMBALANGODA Why wasn’t the pitch roller not stored properly? The tragic incident involving a student of Ananda College, Colombo shows that somebody had neglected his duty in ensuring that the playground was safe from any unforeseeable danger, before commencing sports activities. Public opinion is that this unfortunate tragedy could have been easily avoided. The cricket pitch ground roller in question had been lying in an open space on the playground and not in a place which could be considered safe at all. In case the roller had been placed away from the ground in a corner, there would have been no necessity at all for the children to meddle with it and to move it as they had done, and the accident could have been well avoided. The school’s position that the child was pinned against the wall while playing with the roller is untenable from an intellectual moral and practical standpoint. That Ananda College Maradana, has a high reputation for being a leading school in the country is one thing, but children are particularly precious to their parents. For parents, their children come before the school and everything else on this earth. It would take years for the parents of this unfortunate child to recover from this severe shock. NANDARATNA RAJAPAKSHA\r\n AMBALANGODA Slightly yellowish teeth are healthy Most people think that shining white teeth are attractive and healthy. Strictly speaking, slightly yellowish teeth are healthy. Some people resort to brushing their teeth vigorously to keep their teeth white. In such instances, the enamel which covers the outer portion of the teeth gets worn-out and the internal dentin layer becomes exposed. such people are subject to discomfort while eating hot or cold food. Ladies who bleach their teeth in beauty parlours also face the danger of losing enamel. For healthy clean teeth, the following are recommended. a) Select a suitable toothpaste recommended by your dentist. Never be carried away by advertisements. b) Brushing your teeth twice a day is acceptable but never use a hard brush unless recommended by your dentist. c) Chewing cane sugar is good. In Jaffna people chew palmyrah fruits. Take special care of your teeth especially when you are diabetic. neglect may result in paralysis. S.R. BALACHANDRA\r\n COLOMBO 6 ',No

They have funded for diversified areas such as education, irrigation and the road development sectors. Kalu Ganga Development Project, South Eastern University Development Project, bridges rehabilitation and reconstruction project and strengthening of tertiary education and administrative infrastructure in tsunami affected areas are the significant projects being implemented with KFAED assistance. The loan agreement for US $ 36 million (Kuwait Dinar 10 million) for the reconstruction and rehabilitation of 25 bridges of the national road network was signed by Finance and Planning Ministry Secretary Dr. P.B. Jayasundera on behalf of the Sri Lankan government and KFAED Deputy Director General Hesham Al-Waqayan at the ministry on Thursday. The proposed project will complement the program for construction of 1,000 rural bridges island wide. The government\'s development policy framework has identified the necessity of rehabilitating and improving the country\'s national road network on a priority basis to improve the efficiency of transport services. Accordingly, the government has given priority to widen and improve narrow bridges which are very old. The deterioration caused over time by heavy traffic and adverse environment conditions have resulted in higher frequency of repairs to old bridges and reduced carrying capacity. It is required to construct and rehabilitate narrow bridges of the national road network by increasing its connectivity covering the entire island and expanding opportunities of people\'s access suitable for current requirements. ',No

Tamil New Tigers rechristened as LTTE on May 5, 1976 Collective Responsibility - Guilty by Association * Did Prabhakaran hijack what the Tamil politicians wanted or were both following the same objective via different routes? * Did it serve both Prabhakaran and elements of the Tamil political set up to annihilate all moderate Tamil politicians who were for peacefully co-existing with other communities? * How many Tamil civilians do not wish to make their stand about the LTTE or the TNA known, and to negate the false assumption that Tamils wish to live separate from the other communities in Sri Lanka? * Why do Tamils not come out to say that most Tamils in reality live outside of the \'Tamil Homeland\' thus putting to rest the charade and lies? Does the Tamil civil population not hold the key to silencing all critics and nullifying separatist claims on the grounds that Tamils cannot live with Sinhalese? TNA-LTTE TNA is an unregistered alliance formed in 2001. TNA comprises ACTC (All Ceylon Tamil Congress) / EPRLF (Eelam People\'s Revolutionary Liberation Front) / TELO (Tamil Eelam Liberation Organization) / TULF (Tamil United Liberation Front) LTTE\'s influence over voters enabled TNA politicians to enter Parliament - Investigate this. TNA and LTTE are making the identical demands. The only factor that puts the two apart is LTTE had arms. Now with the LTTE factor removed TNA is continuing the same demands. LTTE-TNA alliance 2001 TNA election manifesto: TNA announced that the LTTE was the \'sole Tamil National Entity\' in 2001. TNA claimed LTTE was the SOLE REPRESENTATIVE of the Tamil people in Sri Lanka and LTTE had a right to negotiate on behalf of the Tamil people. Investigate! a) Recognition of Tamils as a distinct nationality b) Recognition of a Tamil Homeland with guaranteed territorial integrity c) Recognition of the inalienable right of self-determination of the Tamil nation. d) Recognition of the right to full citizenship and fundamental democratic rights of all Tamils. 2004 TNA election manifesto stated:  Former LTTE child soldiers. File photo  \"Accepting the LTTE\'s leadership as the national leadership of \'Tamil Eelam\' Tamils and the Liberation Tigers as the sole and authentic representative of the Tamil people, let us devote our full cooperation for the ideals of the Liberation Tigers\' struggle with honesty and steadfastness. Let us endeavour determinedly, collectively as one group, one nation, one country, transcending race and religious differences, under the leadership of the LTTE, for a life of liberty, honour and justice for the Tamil people.\" Investigate: * TNA Parliamentarians attending pro-LTTE events abroad and locally throughout 30 years * TNA Parliamentarians speaking from LTTE stages, delivering speeches that echo separatist sentiment. * TNA Parliamentarians paying homage to dead LTTE suicide cadres * TNA Parliamentarians communicating and liaising with LTTE fronts overseas * Foreign mission briefings/country data on Sri Lanka that describes \'TNA as a pro-LTTE party\' while international media too carries the same description * 2004 EU Election Observation Mission Chief John Cushnahan released the EU report on June 17, 2004 clearly establishing the LTTE-TNA alliance: Quote: Firstly, the LTTE intended that no other rival Tamil party (or Tamil candidate from the mainstream political alliances) to the TNA would be able to claim to represent Tamil interests. A chilling message to this effect was sent early in the campaign when a UNP candidate and an EPDP activist were murdered. Incidents such as this seriously restricted the right of the parties other than the TNA to campaign freely in the Northern and Eastern Districts. During the 2004 elections, the major incidents of violence was perpetrated by the LTTE, whereas at the earlier elections; the primary source of the violence (although not all), were the two largest political parties. Unquote * 2009 statement by Anandasangaree (President/Secretary of TULF) to the President of Sri Lanka: \"Democratic Tamil National Alliance considers the TNA, as the first and the worst enemy of the Tamil People. They should take full responsibility, among many other matters, for the loss of several thousands of lives and for causing injuries for many more..... All have become paupers now. They will find hardly anything left when they return to their homes one day. All these or at least 90 per cent of these could have been saved and total displacement could have been avoided if only the TNA had the forethought to advise the LTTE to release the people from their grip, to go anywhere they liked. The TNA is blamed for this because, when everyone, every organization, every country, the EU, the UN etc. had made this request specifically, only the TNA kept on asking for the war to stop * When the 8,000 students who sat for the G.C.E(O/L) exam were taken away for compulsory training by the LTTE the TNA kept mum. Some of them are now dead and others are under detention by the Government. Where are the children and grand-children of the TNA MPs. Will the TNA at least now tell the world as to what happened to the students at Sencholai. .... Who are these gentleman of the TNA now wanting to form an alliance with the DTNA? They are the people whom the LTTE elected to represent them in Parliament fraudulently, and it is they who unashamedly claimed the LTTE as the sole representatives of the people. The LTTE is no more and hence they do not need any representation in Parliament. Neither the PLOTE nor the EPRLF (Pathmanabha) gave any indication to Mr. Srikantha who met me by appointment and the other two by accident. As for me I will not touch the TNA even with a \"barge pole\". The dead, the injured and those living in the IDP camps deprived of all their rights will not pardon us if we have any deal with them. The TNA should not under-estimate our alliance partners who cannot be bought over with a mayor-ship or with any membership in Parliament as they sold themselves in April 2004. .... \"For five years I fought a lone battle, amidst threat to my life, unbearable humiliations etc. I was also christened as a \"traitor\". I now feel exonerated. Let the souls of the dead haunting our homes bless me and not curse me.\" V. Anandasangaree, has signed the statement as President - TULF and Secretary - DTNA/2009. Incidentally, Anandasangaree had to eat his own words because he has now joined the TNA alliance which he accused of all this in 2009. Guilty by association In investigating and establishing the links with LTTE-TNA every killing and act crime committed by the LTTE automatically incriminates the TNA as being guilty by association. LTTE\'s crimes include suicide missions, destruction of civilian property, premeditated targeting of civilians, denying fundamental rights under the UN Charter to Tamil men, women and even children by forcibly recruiting them as terrorists, denying children their right to life, right to live with parents, right to education and right to freedom of movement, banks heists, political assassinations, narcotic trade, human smuggling and a host of other crimes which TNA by association with LTTE becomes culpable for. Investigate! COLLECTIVE RESPONSIBILITY - COLLECTIVE GUILT Allied Forces Denazified Germany - LTTE/TNA need to be \'denazified\' as well. Germany was denazified by the Allied Forces with the objective to totally eliminate any ideology associated with Nazism. Sri Lanka must totally eliminate ideology associated with SEPARATISM. * Germans could not decry against foreign occupation (The Sri Lankan Army is the National Army of Sri Lanka and the GOSL has every right to position its troops wherever they like and their numbers cannot be questioned by any nation or group) * Germans could not object to foreign military presence which remained for 13 years in Germany * Denazification is a legal term coined by Pentagon in 1943 (Denazification Directives) * The Allies thus removed all physical symbols associated with Nazi regime. * The Nazi Party was abolished (TNA is the political arm of the LTTE) * Nazi links to cultural, social, intellectual, economic or even politics was abolished. * Everyone who supported Hitler or the Nazis was held accountable and charged with war crimes at the Nuremberg Trials. (WE DEMAND INVESTIGATION OF EVERYONE WHO SUPPORTED LTTE/TNA IN THEIR CRIMES FROM 1980S TO DATE) * The Nuremberg Trials aimed to purge all elements of Nazism - even the Swastika was removed * German and Austrian refugees had to fill a questionnaire that categorized them - 1.5 million Germans were categorized as hard-core Nazis * US took over German media and 37 German newspapers, 6 radio stations, 314 theatres, 642 cinemas, 101 magazines, 237 book publishers, 7,384 book dealers and printers and made sure there was NO CRITICISM of Allied occupation or its troops. * More than 30,000 book titles ranging from school textbooks to poetry were banned, those who possessed these books were punished *All artwork related to Nazism was prohibited *If denial of holocaust is considered a CRIME and is BANNED. The denial of LTTE crimes must be equally considered a CRIME and should be BANNED. 30 years of suffering LTTE put Sri Lanka through cannot be forgotten. Each of us are victims in our own way. We need to delineate who made merry through LTTE terror and who suffered because of LTTE terror. Investigate. *Allied forces ran posters in German which read \'YOU ARE GUILTY OF THIS\' or \"THESE ATROCITIES: YOUR GUILT. Photos of dead humans carried headings with \"WHO IS GUILTY\" or \"THIS TOWN IS GUILTY\". *Germans were forced to see rotting corpses and made to feel guilty in an Allied program to make ALL GERMANS feel \'collectively responsible\' and \'collectively guilty\' for the crimes of the Nazis. This was how US, UK and FRANCE treated ACCOUNTABILITY. Sri Lanka went about a totally different path and for that these same countries find fault. YES WE WANT ACCOUNTABILITY: *We want the world to know that past Indian leaders first mobilized groups of unemployed Tamil youth from Sri Lanka and trained them in India by Indian intelligence and retired army officers. *We want the world to know that the majority of Tamils live outside their propaganda suited \"Tamil Homeland\" and amongst the very Sinhalese they say they cannot live with. *We want the world to know that in countries where minorities like Tamils making just 10 per cent of the population can never hold positions as Chief Justice of Sri Lanka, Inspector General of Police, Chairman of the Central Bank, Chairman of State TV, Heads of Government Departments, University Professors and Vice-Chancellors, Ambassadors and High Commissioners. The person tipped to be the first Tamil PM was gunned down by the LTTE as was the Mayor of Jaffna who became the 1st victim of the LTTE. The public has been demanding that the GOSL INVESTIGATE the LTTE and its links to the TNA. This investigation must commence now. The public must be invited to send all evidence of such ties and the State must bring criminal charges against all the men behind these two movements having proven their guilt by association for the bulk of LTTE crimes meted upon civilians and under Geneva Conventions and all other customary international laws civilians are non-combatants and anyone targeting them in the pre-meditated manner the LTTE had using suicide bombers becomes a war criminal, and if TNA is guilty by association all TNA members can be brought to trial using all the country laws already in place to facilitate this. WE DEMAND AN INVESTIGATION INTO LTTE-TNA ALLIANCE without delay. ',No
'On February Fourth, somewhere in Africa','One hour after the birth of February fourth. I was awakened by the persistent knocking on our front door. I heard voices. “Sri Lanka, Sirilanka, Sir. I am Jacobet, please open the door.” I was scared. We were in Africa, My wife, nine year old daughter, and four year old son. I opened the door. Jacobet was there with a smile. He was our friend who never had failed to carry my wife’s shopping basket at the market. Goes ahead and selects the fruits, vegetables and coconuts. Tips were accepted with a bow. Once we invited him and his mother to our apartment. Both came nattily dressed. When leaving both held our hands and said that it was the first time they had visited a home of a foreigner. “Sir,” he said, “the Army has taken over the country at midnight. Many foreigners are leaving our country. You must stay you are our friend”. I told him that we too wish to leave. “I knew it sir, I was ready’. We were very frightened. “My little brother and sister don’t cry. Your Mamma and Pappa are kind to me. Take your books and toys. Mamma takes all important thing and medicine. I will look after the house, fridge, washing machine, TV and oven -- all other things. Come, we must hurry.” I had fixed our beloved National flag and over it the national flag of my host country, onto a nylon rope to hoist on February 4. It is customary for the host country’s national flag to be above one’s own national flag at non diplomatic locations in a foreign country. I packed both flags in my travelling bag. “Sir you are taking our flag to your country. I am so proud. I love you all.” I too felt proud. “Now where are we going Jacobet?” “To the border, boss. Only the land borders are there. All seaports and airports are closed.” His broken English was giving way to normal English parlance. I was to soon learn that he was an educated lad. “Jacobet, you know I cannot take my official car. The driver brings it in the morning from the parking lot.” “I know,” he smiled. He took us to a Peugeot pick up. Two-hour journeys on beautiful concrete highways through police check points. There were no military personnel to be seen. We reached the border. Lots of vehicles with diplomatic and non-diplomatic numbers. We were served with bisazlibs, cheese and drinks. Chocolates and ice cream for the children. Drinking water and conveniences were also provided. Jacobet spoke to the guard. We drove in with headlights on and shutters down. Jacobet bade us good-bye. “Sir, I am so happy to have been able to help Sri Lanka friends. God Bless Sri Lanka, God Bless my country. Please come back. Your Jacobet and our country want you.” He kissed me on both cheeks. Embraced the children, kissed the hands of my wife. Then he quickly walked away. I knew that he was in tears. So were we. “Bye Jacobet,” said my son. Jacobet ran back to us. Embraced my son and walked away. We were in the chief’s room. A six-foot giant. A charming African smile. “Don’t be scared. You are not in custody. I have never seen such a farewell – the scene between you and my countryman. Very touching. Beautiful He must have really liked you.” “Yes we reciprocated his affection. We liked him very much,” I said. The officer’s speech was quite British. “I am sorry officer, I am not conversant in both languages.” He was amused peeved. “What? Enjoying our bounties and so long with our people. Strange I hold him that we have been in the country only for six months. “Pray what is your nationality?” “Sri Lanka Sir,” I gave him our passports. “ Sri Lankan! By Jove! What a place and time to meet a Sri Lankan. Not bad two of a kind. Both from mineral-rich countries.” Next he requested his deputy to take over. We chatted over biscuits, chocolates and Martini. My son sheepishly approached his massive table. There were six telephones. Our friend literally sprang up from his seat. “Not that my naughty little friend. That goes to the very top. Gosh that was close,” he smiled and gave my son some dinky toys to amuse himself with “Sorry sweet angel,” he smiled, “I have no dolls for you.” “Now tell me from what part of Sri Lanka are you?” I told him that through for some time. “Name sounds familiar, say old boy, does it not have the same name of the river over which the ‘Bridge on the river Kwai’ was shot on location. Lovely bridge, pity they had to blow it up. It was erected to be blown up. I have been to the guesthouse there. Yummy Yummy food. Well fed leeches all around.” We laughed. “Is it not along the road to the Sacred Mountain?” “One of the roads. Tell me, you are very familiar with my country”. “Yes, from North to South, East to West and the salubrious centre. Now with you people here, I am there right now. Do you know, I climbed the Sacred Mountain? Unforgettable. What faith what a happy set of people. Coincidentally it was a February when I walked up to the summit. I felt great. I am no Buddhist, but up there, there was an aura of some Divine Presence. When walking up and descending those happy people said Kaleenai, Kaleenai,” “The word is Karunawai, I said. It means if you please, Bless you, do please oblige. The word is used only by person climbing the Sacred Mountain.” “Please spare me a moment. I wish to take my mind back to those velvety tea plantations, waterfalls, beaches and the smiling faces of your people.” “Sir, you are more a philosopher than a soldier”. “Yes! Philosophy helps. Shows a soldier that he is there not to fight but to defend.” I told him about my assignment in his country, and about Jacobet. “Just call me Fred. Brigadier Fred at your service. Yes, Jacobet we need persons like him. I want them to look after our country after us. I’ll get him here.” I saw the farewell scenes. Who else but a Sri Lankan can be the recipient of such love and respect from one of us. I am not surprised. My eyes were glistening. So were my wife’s. We felt proud of our little gem. Fred understood the reason for our tears. “Do you know what day it is today? “Fourth of February, Fred.” “Anything special about the date?” “The day we celebrate the anniversary of our independence.” I told him about the flags in my travel bag. “So you are taking my flag to your country?” “Why are you taking memories about my country?” “I am taking back memories of your country, we were pampered by your lovely people for seven months. They were under this flag.” Fred stood up. He spread his national flag and ours on his table. Next he saluted. We stood at attention. Eyes closed. Tears were falling down our cheeks. In my mind’s eye I could see our majestic lion wagging his tail and licking the hands of Fred whose hands were on the two flags. Fred too was biting his lips. Yes! Only our petite jewel could bring such sincerity emotions and genuine reverence from a person in uniform of another country. “Now for my story,” said Fred. We were seated. He was on his feet. “My father was a diplomat in your country. Thirty six years exactly, to this very day. Sir, four memorable milestones. Today. Your freedom day anniversary, our military takes over, my fiftieth birthday and this momentous meeting incidentally it was in a February that I reached the summit of the Sacred Mountain, rang the bell once after venerating the sacred footprint of the Buddha. Only fools say that coincidences are very rare.” We wished him a Happy Birthday. Then a savory surprise. My wife extracted a lovely rich cake from her travelling bag. She had made it for our Freedom Day. Fred kissed us. He called his colleagues. He cut the cake amidst the lovely bass voices of his friends singing Happy Birthday. An unforgettable birthday party. His parents would be overjoyed to hear about this happening. They would cry. He began his story we listened. I was quite young, holidaying in your country. February 4th. A long holiday we were returning from a coastal resort. My dad was at the wheel. An accident. He was rushed to the main hospital in Colombo. Severe injuries. Internal bleeding. Four surgeons were attending on him. They called their chief surgeon who was holidaying outstation with the family. An ambulance brought him. A 5 1/2 hour operation. Our Mission personnel and foreign office directors were there. My little brother and my mother were with me in the medical superintendent’s room. The four surgeons and the specialist told us that Dad would be alright. My mother burst into tears and asked them as to how we could repay them. All pointed their fingers at the specialist. Fred put his arms round us. “You know what that beautiful doctor did? He did exactly what I am doing to this Sri Lankan family. He put his arms round his colleagues and said ‘Madam, today is our Independence day anniversary. All of us learnt to be doctors without spending any fees. The state looked after us. Postgraduate courses fees were also free. Madam, young sirs, what more can we give our beloved country back in gratitude. Your husband will be up and about very soon. Look after him.’ “You know, he scarified his holiday with his family in order to save my father’s life. A typical Sri Lankan par excellence.” Many were wiping a tear. Next he gave some orders phone calls. Smiles. “I shall inform your High Commission. You all can hop across the border. My friends on the other side will help you. You can spend a day or two in their capital. Relax in a hotel before going back to your country. Safe journey.” We were perspiring. ‘Don’t you worry Sir. Here’s some money and gold. They are from our fleeing parasites,” we wanted to contact Our Mission. “Sorry not today. They are enjoying your Independence Day in their homes,” he said with an impish wink and smile. Sorry old boy. A fearful parting. On the other side a lovely Toyota took us to their capital hotel rooms had been reserved. Five stars V.I.P. pampering that included a tour of the city and loads of souvenirs and lovely dress materials and toys. Left for home, first class air tickets to Colombo with return tickets to Fred’s country capital and to the state where I was stationed. We returned. A letter on arrival ‘Dear Sir welcome back. I am on a mission abroad. Managed to locate Jacobet. I am going to make him an officer and gentleman. Copies of all correspondence by us with your Mission, your High Commission, ministry concerned with your services here, the Heads of school where your children are studying are enclosed. House keys are with the state Governor’s secretary. Tell Madam that the fridge is well stocked. House all cleaned up. God Bless, both our countries. God Bless the Fourth of February where Freedom, Brotherhood, Gratitude. Love and unsurpassable memories were experienced by all of us. My friend. I tell you today that the pearl of the Indian Ocean will never lost its luster and will continue to enjoy Happy and Peaceful February Fourths. Ad infinitum – your African friend Fred.’ ',No

'Ukrainian President returns to work','UKRAINE: Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych returned to work on Monday from four days of sick leave after opposition leaders appealed for Western assistance and an injured militant accused of rioting left the country for medical treatment. As he recovers from what officials said was an \"acute respiratory infection\", Yanukovych faces a crisis with no solution in sight that has dragged on for over two months and has pitted Russia against Europe and the United States. Opposition leaders have asked the West, which has so far pledged only verbal support for their cause, to mediate in talks with Yanukovych to prevent \"misunderstandings\". They have also requested \"real financial aid\" after more than two months of protests that have left much of central Kiev looking like a war zone and hobbled an already frail economy. Speaking to a protest rally of over 60,000 people on Sunday, former economy minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk said Western officials had assured him that funding was on its way. \"They are ready to do it,\" he told the crowd. The protests touched off in November when Yanukovych turned his back on a partnership deal with the European Union under pressure from Moscow -- Ukraine\'s former master. They have since expanded beyond Kiev into traditionally pro-opposition western Ukraine but also into central and eastern parts normally considered a heartland for Yanukovych. Four people -- two protesters and two policemen -- were killed at the height of the clashes last month and more than 500 people have been injured, according to official figures. AFP ',No
'2013 safest year for scheduled international aviation','Preliminary data released by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) has confirmed that 2013 was the safest year ever recorded in terms of fatalities for scheduled international air transport operations. Although the number of fatal accidents involving scheduled commercial operations remained steady at nine during 2013, fatalities themselves were down a significant 53.5 per cent from 2012, dropping to only 173 compared to 372 the previous year. Using 2010 as a baseline, fatalities have fallen by a whopping 76 per cent and 2013 represents the third consecutive year in which air transport fatalities have continued to decrease. \"These results are no surprise given the level of commitment our sector demonstrates, year-in and year-out, to improving the safety of the global air transport network,\" remarked ICAO Secretary General, Raymond Benjamin. \"Recent years have seen a tremendous increase in the level of cooperation and partnership on aviation safety priorities and we are now seeing the fruits of these efforts born out by these remarkable 2013 outcomes.\" Using ICAO Regional Aviation Safety Group areas of responsibility as a basis for comparison, the Middle East had no fatal accidents, Africa and the Asia/Pacific each had one, Europe had two and America saw the highest number with a total of five fatal accidents in 2013. Also of note was that, of the nine total fatal accidents worldwide, seven occurred during the approach or go-around phases of flight. \"Safety is ICAO\'s guiding and most fundamental Strategic Objective,\" stressed Dr. Olumuyiwa Benard Aliu, President of the ICAO Council. \"ICAO, together with a wide range of partnering organizations who are contributing to our cooperative international safety programmes, will continue to coordinate the investment and collaboration needed to ensure that air transport remains the safest means of rapidly moving people and goods worldwide.\" (IATA) ',No
'[Book Review - (05-02-2014)]','Lankan\'s synoptic view of Gandhara art Title: Asirimath Gandaraya Author: Chandana Wijekoon Publisher: S Godage and Brothers 96 Pages Asirimath Gandaraya (The Glory That was Gandara: Journey in Search of Buddhist Ruins of Pakistan) is a book welcome by the readers who know only Sinhala language to communicate. This is the third book I have read about Gandara Art. The first two are Sinhala translations. What is striking here is that this present book is not a translation, but a book containing first-hand account of a versatile journalist who had visited, spent time viewing and collecting information by talking to those whom he had met while on his tour and then pen down what he had gathered in a book form for those keen on Gandhara art. The Buddhist art and sculpture describe the religious concepts in the form of visual expressions. The birth, enlightenment and the passing away of the Buddha, Jathaka stories, and stupas are familiar subjects to Sinhalese readers. It is not necessary to describe the life of the Buddha at length. Chandana Wijekoon, a senior journalist attached to Dinamina Editorial, visited the Gandhara as a part of his journey in search of Buddhist ruins of Pakistan and had the opportunity to see the real state of some Buddhist monuments and artifacts both in and out of the museum. Wijekoon\'s efforts in writing this book calls for our appreciation. We should congratulate the author for finding time to put in an orderly manner all that could be included to make sense and readable. Of course, opinions could differ to what he has written and expressions of divergent views would only help the author to be conscious when undertaking a similar project in the future. We should also appreciate writing a book of this nature for the sole benefit of the Sinhala readers to enhance their knowledge in respect of Gandara Art. The book deals with some important aspects of the Gandara art focusing basically on salient features of the life and times of the Gauthama Buddha. In my view, the author has satisfactorily presents what he has seen and also what he was able to grasp during his short tour in Gandhara. In his introductory note, author Wijekoon says: \"It is my personal visit to Gandhara which inspired me to write, the glory that was Gandhara.\" He also has the humility to accept that his work is not a complete thesis of Gandhara, but a result of discussions he held with the officials in Takshila museum. \"It makes me realize the importance of providing an opportunity to refresh the memory of the Sri Lankan Sinhala speaking reader about his Buddhist heritage. Hence I decided to write this booklet\". In his preface, Ven Prof Pathegama Gnanasara Thero of the Sri Lanka Buddhist University, Anuradhapura, says the book \'rekindles one\'s memory of the Sinhala cultural community about Buddhist heritage\'. The writer\'s attempts at exploring and identifying ancient Buddhist civilization and culture are commendable.\" The book consists of three main chapters and adds index along with a list of reference books. The first two chapters deal with the history of Gandhara and Thakshila and goes on to touch upon the origin and development of the Buddha Statues and moves on to bring out several aspects or the salient points related to Gandhara art, as he had assimilated by seeing, speaking and reading about them. This undoubtedly calls for heavy criticism by those who have a deeper understanding about Gandhara art, but not by those who have no deeper knowledge of the subject the author takes pains to express his own way. So the book is a welcome initiative to the ordinary reader and the author\'s aim seem to be, tell the tale of Gandhara to the well meaning devotees of the Buddha and create an interest in them to visit the sites. The author states that Heenayana Buddhism is very popular. The followers raised the Buddha to god-like person and that concept may have influenced others to think that making sculpture of the Buddha was a task beyond human capability. But the author rightly points out that at no stage the Buddha wanted to show off and wanted to appear as a person who had superseded the human nature, but remained and acted as one who had shown the humanity the path to cross the life circle - samsara. With the passage of time, kings and emperors got their artistes and sculptors to make statues of the Thathagatha for the benefit of the adherents of the Buddha. It was during the King Kaniska art and sculpture making take place and Greek influence is very much evident with the toga being used to adorn the Buddha statue. The author also refers to the historical sketches of the Bhikkhu Fa-hsien and other travelers both religious and laymen on the Buddha statues they had seen in Gandhara and elsewhere to educate the readers. In this 54-page booklet there are important photographs mostly in black and white showing the grandeur of the sculpture of Gandhara. These make the reader understand the Buddhist art tradition of Pakistan Gandhara art. Wijekoon\'s work could also be a source book to those studying art and culture of our neighbouring countries and to gauge to what an extent their influence have impressed our local artists and to see their creation in that light. - WIRUMA Atonement – a historical and reflexive novel Dr Senarath Tennakoon Atonement is a historical novel, set during and just before, the Second World War, its action taking place in 1935 and 1940. Its narrator is Briony Tallis, a young girl who is looking back at the events that have taken place. Briony relates these events when she is old. She in her old age write and rewrites these events. The novel is the product of Briony\'s atonement for an act she committed as a child. She keeps on writing and rewriting the story of what happened and deals it with a sense of guilt. Hence, Atonement is a reflexive novel too. Atonement was first published in 2001. It has been translated into French, German, Spanish, Catalan, Brazilian, Portuguese, Lithuanian and Japanese. It has won The People\'s Booker Prize (2001), the National Book Critics Award, the Los Angeles Times Prize for Fiction, and the Santiago Prize for the European Novel. Its author, Ian McEwen was born in Aldershot, England on 21 June 1948. His father was an army officer. During his childhood he grew up in Singapore, Tripoly and Germany. From 1967-70 he studied English and French at the University of Sussex. In 1971 he obtained a MA from the University of East Anglia. In 1984 he was elected Fellow of the Royal Society for Literature. In 1987 he won the Whitbread Prize for The Child in Time; and traveled in Russia as a delegate for European disarmament. In 1989 he was awarded an honorary doctorate by the University of Sussex. In 1988 his Amstradam won the Booker Prize. In 2000 he was awarded the CBE (Companion of the British Empire). He has written short stories and several novels. Some of his well known novels are The Child in Time (1987), Black Dogs (1992), The Day Dreamer (1994, children\'s novel). Amstradam (1998) and Atonement (2001) His Enduring Love was filmed in 2004 and Atonement was filmed in 2006. In all McEwen\'s fiction there is a key moment, either an accidental or an inadvertent event which leads to the destruction of a life or of lives. It is a point from which there is no turning back, and from which a terrible and inevitable train of events unravels (Rooney, 2006). Atonement consists of three parts and an epilogue. The first part of the novel which takes half of the novel is confined to the activities of one day, the hottest day of 1935 in the English country estate of the Tallis family. The Tallieses belong to the upper middle class that enjoy a lifestyle of privileges through their acquired wealth. But they lacked social privilege. Jack Tallis who although a civil servant has no personal power. His job is to carry out the orders of his superior. The well mannered life of the Tallis is introduced in the first part and slowly and steadily McEwen presents the key character, the thirteen year old Briony Tallis who is trying to produce a melodrama which she has written. Her three visiting cousins help her in the performance of some parts of it. But she has to drop this literary composition as she is emotionally disturbed by an incident which she views through a window. She saw her sister Celia and Robbie Turner, the son of the cleaner of their house. Briony witnesses Celia stripping herself and jumping into the fountain in the grounds of their house while being watched by Robbie. Briony is puzzled with what she sees as she is unaware of the fact that Celia had dived to recover some pieces from a valuable vase that Celia and Robbie had just broken. Celia and Robbie know each other as they have been at Cambridge University and they have just completed their degrees. Robbie has an attraction towards Celia and he writes a note with an obscene ending and hands it to Briony and requests her to give it to Celia. But Briony reads it before giving to Celia and she is horrified at the obscene remarks. However Celia knows that Briony has read the note. On another occasion, Briony sees Celia and Robbie making love in the library; but she misinterprets the scene as Robbie attacking her sister and she thinks Robbie to be mad. Briony finds her other cousin Lola on the island in the lake. She sees a man leaving Lola. Briony thinks that it is Robbie who has raped Lola and run away. Mainly because of Briony\'s evidence Robbie is arrested for rape and imprisoned. This incident marks the end of the first part of the novel. There is also some account of Celia\'s brother Leon who brings home his friend Paul Marshall. Paul is an unpleasant character who has a high opinion of himself. He manages the manufacture of a multi colored chocolate bar. Leon works in a bank and spends his time rowing and seeing friends. Part one is structured in the usual traditional manner dividing it into several chapters (14 chapter\'s altogether). The second part of the novel is set five years later in northern France during the retreat of the British army to Dunkirk. Robbie and two corporals, Nettle and Mace are on their way to the beach for evacuation and are horrified at the damage is incurred to the countryside by repeated German air attacks. Robbie has been allowed to join the army after serving a part of his term of imprisonment. He is still in love with Celia; But only through exchange of letters between them. By now Celia has severed her links with her family as they still consider Robbie to be the rapist. But Celia knows that Robbie is innocent. However, it was fortunate that Briony has withdrawn her original statement and now she considers Robby to be innocent. Robbie\'s wound on his shoulder worsens during the long walk to Dunkirk. He is delirious at times. The second part of the novel ends with Robby sleeping in the celler of a house in Dunkirk the night before the evacuation from the beaches. Part two of the novel is largely revolving around a single character and that is Robbie. McEwen deals with the moods of Robbie with flashbacks on his previous experiences. It is introspective. It also explains the happenings of the Second World War in France. The third part of the novel is set in England in the summer of 1940. Briony is now a trainee nurse working in a London Hospital. There is an influx of wounded soldiers from Dunkirk to this hospital and Briony is terribly busy attending to them. But she is still devoted to literary works. She has sent a story based on her childhood experience at the fountain, to a literary journal. But it was rejected with encouragement for her to continue writing. In the meantime Briony attends the church wedding between Paul Marshall and Lola as an uninvited guest. After the church service she goes to meet Celia in her flat. But Celia remains hostile to her. Bobbie is also there and Briony reveals that it was Paul Marshall who raped Lola and not Robbie. As Paul and Lola was married it is not possible to bring Paul before the courts as Lola would not speak against Paul who is now her husband. In the end Briony promises to write a detailed account about the raping incident to her parents so as to reveal the truth. This account would become Atonement. In the final epilogue written by Briony in 1999 the readers come to know that the novel is the culmination of a series of drafts that Briony has created during her life, her act of atonement. It is atonement and guilt of Briony that finds a prominent place in the thematic content of the novel. The sexual attack on Lola was reported by Briony as being done by Robbie. But Briony has not seen it completely. It has been a shadowy event although she has given false evidence. This put the lives of Robbie and Celia miserable. But Briony has to suffer a lifetime of guilt until she reveals the truth after a very long tie, when she is old. The alleged rape occurred when she was just an adolescent. Not only Briony, Paul Marshall and Lola too are guilty as they remained silent about the incident. Both of them were participants of the incident. But as they kept silent, poor Robbie had to suffer imprisonment. Even after their marriage they opt to remain silent. The other theme is the Second World War which is described in part two and three. While the wanton destruction of the war has been described, the wound of Robbie is presented as a cruel symbol of the war. ',No

'Dominant England humble Scotland in Calcutta Cup','England got their Six Nations campaign back on track with a crushing 20-0 Calcutta Cup victory over Scotland at Murrayfield on Saturday. Luther Burrell and Mike Brown, as they\'d done in defeat by France last weekend, both scored tries as the 132nd edition of international rugby union\'s oldest fixture saw Scotland rendered pointless by England for the first time since a 15-0 loss at Murrayfield in 1978. Had not fly-half Owen Farrell missed several goalkicks, the final scoreline might have been even more lopsided. Scotland made three changes from the side that opened the Six Nations with a 28-6 loss to Ireland last weekend, with Australia coach Scott Johnson controversially dropping captain Kelly Brown and giving his place at openside flanker to debutant Chris Fusaro. Tommy Seymour replaced the injured Sean Maitland while Matt Scott was brought into midfield instead of Duncan Taylor. Scrum-half Greig Laidlaw took over the captaincy from Brown. England, whose first match in charge under coach Stuart Lancaster was a 13-6 win at Murrayfield two years ago, were unchanged following an agonising 26-24 loss to France in Paris. The parasite-infested Murrayfield pitch was boggy even before driving rain during the game turned it into a quagmire. And three minutes in Farrell lost his footing as he saw a 30 metre penalty attempt drift wide. However, England were 3-0 in front minutes later when scrum-half Danny Care dropped a goal after gathering the ball out wide from a ruck. Scotland then forced a penalty from a ruck turnover but Laidlaw pushed a 43 metre touchline effort wide. England, with Care bossing his forwards effectively, won another penalty which Farrell kicked for a line-out barely 10 metres from Scotland\'s line. From the ensuing catch and drive, England mauled before Care\'s well-timed pass sent onrushing centre Burrell in for a try. The score stayed at 10-0 in England\'s favour as both Laidlaw, with a kick rebounding off the post, and Farrell missed penalties. England were gaining ascendancy up front and Care\'s excellent cross-field grubber kick set up a line-out deep inside Scotland\'s 22. Scotland hooker Ross Ford\'s wayward throw went over the head of intended recipient Jim Hamilton. England regathered before a Scottish infringement gave Farrell an easy penalty chance which he duly kicked. Shortly before half-time Burrell nearly had a second try when, following a break by Farrell, he took the ball on the burst only to be hauled down just short of the line by veteran Scotland wing Sean Lamont. As it was, England turned round with a healthy 13-0 lead. Not for the first time, Scotland -- rendered tryless for the second match in a row -- suffered from self-inflicted wounds, a promising position undone by a knock-on while missed tackles allowed England to gain ground.

'Legal aid Commission','Rights of migrant workers and their families The International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families - 1990 defines the term “migrant worker” as a person who is to be engaged, is engaged or has been engaged in a remunerated activity in a State of which he or she is not a national. People migrate for various reasons such as education, permanent settlement, business, as refugees, training and employment. International trends International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families was adopted by UN General Assembly resolution 45/158 of December 18, 1990. This convention stipulates basic freedoms of migrant workers such as freedom of movement to and from their countries of origin, right to life, freedom from torture or cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment, freedom from slavery, servitude or compulsory labour, freedom of thought, expression, consciences and religion, right to privacy, right to property etc. It also explains political, economic, social and employment rights such as right to equal treatment with nationals in respect of remuneration and other conditions of work such as overtime, holidays, social security benefits, right to join freely any trade union, right to emergency medical care etc. This convention also stipulates provisions on due process, family and rights of children of migrant workers such as right to name, registration of birth and nationality, right of access to education etc:. The above mentioned convention is applicable to all migrant workers and members of their families, without distinction of any kind, during the entire migration process, which includes preparation for migration, departure, transit and the entire period of stay and remunerated activity in the State of employment and return to the state of habitual residence. Sri Lanka acceded this convention on March 11, 1996. Migrant workers contribute a considerable amount of foreign exchange to the economy of Sri Lanka. They need special protection and assistance to ensure their job security and safety. The number of Sri Lankan migrant workers has increased over the years. Legislation has been enacted to upgrade their conditions of work and to prevent illegal migration. Poverty, low income level, higher education are some of the causes for migration. Most of the Sri Lankans migrate to Middle East region for employment as unskilled workers, housemaids and semi skilled workers. A large number of temporary migrant workers have traditionally focused on the unskilled labour market in the Middle East and the other skilled categories have focused on East Asia and West. Brain drain is also a form of migration. Most of the Sri Lankan women migrate to Middle East regions as housemaids. Most of those housemaids, low skilled and unskilled migrants are subjected to a high level of violation of human rights including labour rights, harassment and abuse in work places. Some migrant workers commit crimes and offences abroad and face difficulties (eg: Rizana’s case). Most of them are unaware of the laws enforceable in the recipient countries. Sri Lankan approach Human trafficking is prohibited in Sri Lanka under Section 360C of the Penal Code (Amendment) Act, No. 16 of 2006. The Sri Lanka Bureau of Foreign Employment (SLBFE), is the foremost institution working for the welfare of Sri Lankan migrant workers and their families. It was established in 1985 under the Act No. 21 of 1985 and amended by Act No. 4 of 1994 and Act No.56 of 2009, this Act is the primary legislation that deals with foreign employment. Under the Sri Lanka Bureau of Foreign Employment Act No. 21 of 1985, it is a legal requirement for all workers leaving Sri Lanka for overseas employment to be registered with the Sri Lanka Bureau of Foreign Employment (SLBFE) prior to their departure. This registration procedure ensures job security, safety and welfare of migrant workers. All those leaving Sri Lanka for employment for the first time or those who have completed their initial contract overseas and want to go back again or those who are hoping to change jobs while they’re overseas have to register themselves with the SLBFE. The license obtained by a migrant worker from the SLBFE prior to departure is valid only for a period of two years and if by any chance that person wants to extend his stay and continue his employment there he can re-register himself through the Sri Lankan High Commission / Embassy located in that particular country or by getting his relatives to re-register him with the SLBFE head office or the district office. Registering or renewing the registration with the SLBFE is highly beneficial while non-registration and non-renewal is very disadvantageous to migrant workers. Prior to departure, an agreement giving all the conditions of employment has to be signed by the employee (migrant worker). This has to be done at the SLBFE Head Office after all three parties (The SLBFE, the agent and the employee/migrant worker) agrees to all conditions stipulated in the agreement. This new arrangement has to be adhered to by the foreign employment agent as well as the prospective employee to ensure the safety and welfare of the employee. The agency has to obtain a foreign employment agency license and it would be valid only for a period of one year from the date of issue. The agency can renew its agency license by submitting the completed application form available at the Sri Lanka Bureau of Foreign Employment (SLBFE). The agency has to submit the renewal application 30 days before the license expires and the SLBFE would then evaluate past performances, inspect the agency office, equipment, records and grant approval for the renewal of the agency license. SLBFE provides key services to migrant workers. It has a special Investigation Service to arrest illegitimate and dishonest foreign employment agency officers and a police unit at its Head Office to speed up the obtaining of Police clearance reports of persons hoping to go overseas of employment. Migrant workers face difficulties in their jobs due to lack of knowledge of the conditions of their service agreements. To overcome those difficulties provisions have been made to read and sign the service agreement in the presence of an SLBFE officer. When job vacancies are offered by foreign employment agencies, SLBFE checks through the Embassies/High Commissions in those respective countries before giving approval to the same. If the foreign employment agency breaks any clause mentioned in the agreement, the SLBFE takes steps to protect the rights of migrant workers. SLBFE also register migrant workers and agencies. When a person obtains registration license SLBFE provides many benefits including life insurance, housing loans, loans for self employment, scholarships and support for the education of their school-going children. SLBFE also inquires into complaints regarding migrant workers and provides dispute settlement services. Consular Affairs Division of the Ministry of External Affairs in Sri Lanka also assists migrant workers. Compensation section of Consular Affairs Division assists Sri Lanka Migrant Workers abroad and their next of kin to obtain compensation, unpaid salaries, social Insurance benefits, blood Money (In case of an accident or murder when the victim is entitled to receive) and to repatriate personal belongings of the demised migrant workers to Sri Lanka. Death section of Consular Affairs Division makes arrangements to repatriate the human remains of Sri Lankans to Sri Lanka or bury/cremate the human remains abroad. Authentication Section of Consular Affairs Division Authenticates documents such as Birth, Marriage and Death Certificates, Educational Certificates issued by the Examination Department, Affidavits, Police Clearance Certificates, copies of National Identity Card, Passport, Driving License and Export/Commercial Documents etc. Repatriation Section of Consular Division intervenes to solve various difficulties such as, non-payment of salaries, under payment of salaries, harassment, ill treatment and denial of basic facilities. Migrant workers face a lot of difficulties. Many of the sectors demanding female labour overseas have a reputation for high levels of exploitation, sexual harassment and abuse. Housemaids frequently undergo a wide range of unexpected hardships before and after their arrival in the country of employment such as employers\' denial of contract terms, unpaid wages, and loss of savings, premature termination of contract, physical and emotional abuse, sexual harassment, rape, and torture that leads to disability, even death. They also face difficulties in finding employment through a duly registered agency. Incapability of bargaining in drafting contracts of employment, enforcement of laws in the recipient countries is not in favour of migrant workers, lack of legal representation, In the case of domestic workers, they have little or no understanding of the language and do not have access to justice in the country of employment, even if legal action has been taken, the cases can drag on for years during which time the victim has no source of income, pressure from the abuses prevents them from complaining or compels them to withdraw their complaints or negotiate financial statements, which in no way compensate for the abuse caused. In many cases, the victim is counter-accused of the theft or adultery or sentenced to prison and /or severely punished. Illegal agencies in the country promote illegal migration which causes negative impacts on migrant workers. The migrant workers should have a basic understanding about the legal system of the country of migration, register with the Sri Lanka Bureau, make sure that the agency is registered under the Sri Lanka Bureau of Foreign Employment, sign a valid contract of employment, keep a copy of the contract of employment prior to their departure. Raising awareness on legal agencies, illegal agencies, black list agencies, sub agents, and fraud committed by agencies is also important. Migrant women have to take steps regarding custody of their minor children prior to their departure. When women migrate their families face terrible situations such as husband’s erratic behaviour (addicted to drugs, womanizing, smuggling), issues of children (their negative behaviour, starting affairs at very young age, neglect of education, addiction to drugs, raped, abused, neglected, frustrated, abandoned by the guardians), Therefore providing legal assistance to their families including children is essential. LAC provides Legal Aid for migrant workers and their families. A special desk on migrant workers was established in LAC head office in 2005. Raising awareness on laws relating to migration will decrease illegal migration. Providing legal assistance and protection to migrant workers and their families is essential and it constitutes an important segment of access to justice.

'\'Snowmaggedon\' takes aim at US east','US: A major storm blowing in heavy snow and ice gripped large swaths of the winter-weary United States early Friday, leaving a dozen people dead and knocking out power to hundreds of thousands of homes. Thousands of travellers were stranded as flights, including at major air hubs in Atlanta and New York, were canceled, and nearly 800,000 homes and businesses lost power, mainly in Georgia and North and South Carolina. The latest brutal freeze to hammer the eastern states of the country since the start of the year has been dubbed \"snowmaggedon,\" \"mind-boggling\" and \"historic\" by major television networks and forecasters. CNN put the overall death toll at at least 10. CBS News said that at least 11 deaths had been blamed on the ferocious conditions. \"A strengthening area of low pressure moved up the east coast on Thursday bringing with it significant winter weather from the southeast to New England (in the northeast),\" said the National Weather Service, which had warned of a \"mammoth dome\" of Arctic air. The massive storm -- which had an estimated 100 million people in its path in 20 states -- hit Wednesday and by Thursday the National Weather Service had warnings in effect in numerous states, advising people to stay off the \"dangerous\" roads. Earlier, President Barack Obama had declared states of emergency in Georgia and South Carolina in order to deploy federal resources to help deal with the frigid storm. Drivers defied repeated warnings not to travel, and accidents and abandoned cars caused massive traffic jams in North Carolina, with the usually temperate cities of Raleigh and Charlotte transformed into ice- and snow-covered parking lots. North Carolina Governor Pat McCrory urged residents to stay indoors -- even if meant sleeping at work -- rather than risk the treacherous roads. \"If you\'re in a safe warm place, stay in a safe warm place,\" McCrory told CNN. \"We\'ve already had two fatalities and we don\'t want to see more.\" Speciality website FlightAware said airlines canceled at least 3,700 flights on Wednesday and had already shelved 4,500 for Thursday, including many flights to and from New York, Atlanta, Philadelphia and Washington. The US capital\'s downtown was a virtual ghost town as snow blew in late on Wednesday night, with temperatures hovering around 26 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 3 C) but the bracing winds making it feel more like 15 degrees, forecasters said.

'[Big Screen - (17-02-2014)]','Ray Ray (2004) will be screened on February 18 at 6pm at the American Center, No 44, Galle Road, Colombo 3. (Running Time: 153 minutes) Jamie Foxx’s uncannily accurate performance isn’t the only good thing about Ray. Riding high on a wave of Oscar buzz, Foxx proved himself worthy of all the hype by portraying blind R&B legend Ray Charles in a warts-and-all performance that Charles approved shortly before his death in June 2004. Despite a few dramatic embellishments of actual incidents (such as the suggestion that the accidental drowning of Charles’s younger brother caused all the inner demons that Charles would battle into adulthood), the film does a remarkable job of summarizing Charles’s strengths as a musical innovator and his weaknesses as a philandering heroin addict who recorded some of his best songs while flying high as a kite. Seating is limited and is first-come, first-served.

'APPRECIATION - (18-02-2014)','Richard de Zoysa : He will be remembered among patriots for ever It is 24 years since journalist Richard de Zoysa departed from this world. Although 24 years have lapsed since his death, I feel as if he is still alive and kicking due to the eternal friendship he had built with us. Richard was a disciplined and humble youth who showed special skills among our youthful journalists. We should not forget the fact that Richard\'s father Lucien de Zoysa was also a veteran artiste renowned as an English dramatist, director, actor, writer and cricket commentator. He was a son of Francis de Zoysa QC who was member of the State Council for Balapitiya in 1936. This may be the reason that politics, journalism, poetry and drama were embedded in Richard\'s soul. Although Richard\'s father hailed from a leading indigenous family from Balapitiya he used English as the mother tongue. Although Richard\'s grandfather Francis de Zoysa QC was a devout Buddhist, his sons former Finance Minister Stanley de Zoysa, former DIG, Sydney de Zoysa and A.C. de Zoysa PC professed Christianity due to the influence of their mother Ethel de Zoysa of Ragama Walawwa. Richard\'s mother Dr. Manorani de Zoysa was also a great humanist who discared religious, communal and caste differences. This is how Richard became a devout Roman Catholic who won the confidence of members of the Catholic clergy. I am personally aware that Richard led a true and simple life according to religion. He was a prominent personality in the electronic media too. He was a fearless youth with exceptional skills and talents who was popular among the intelligentsia as a film and drama actor, English writer and poet. When Richard was a student at S. Thomas\' College, Mount Lavinia, I met him once at Mount Lavinia junction. At that instance Girija Rajapaksa, a son of Richard\'s aunt was also with me. Girija pointed at Richard and said: “This man will one day become famous like our grandfather Francis de Zoysa.” Several yeas later Girija Rajapaksa died in a motor accident. Girija Rajapaksa was a brother of Jayaneth Rajapaksa who was a member of the Diplomatic Service. Later I reminded Richard about the comment Girija made about him on several occasions and he responded saying: “I think this is the most opportune period to enter politics. But I would like to assist an honest and trustworthy group than contesting to be a politician myself”. Richard was a fearless Leftist. He was distressed over the insane activities of the so called politicians. Once he told me that even Cuban leader Fidel Castro used to exchange correspondence with him. He said: “We must only support an honest group of politicians”. Richard\'s words were true. I told him that I too agreed with his policy. Once Richard told me with great emotion that he had several powerful enemies because he used his pen fearlessly. I told him: “Time is not that good”. Weeks later news about the abduction of Richard de Zoysa from his home was flashed in all newspapers. The following day newspapers reported that Richard\'s body was washed ashore in Moratuwa. During that period of anarchy SP Ronnie Gunasinghe had filed a defamation case against Richard\'s mother against certain statements issued to newspapers by her regarding this incident. Much before the announcement of the decision in this case SP Ronnie Gunasinghe and President Premadasa were killed in a bomb explosion on May 1, 1993. Richard was a journalist who revealed the truth and his name will be remembered among our patriots for ever. Dr. Mirando Obeysekara',No
'Bourne reborn?','Directed by the Irish Kenneth Branagh \'Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit\' seems to be yet another movie which flaunts American elitism to the world. The team behind seems to have picked out some traits from other action movies to mould a hero who will fit the contemporary setup. Though clips of the 9/11 tragedy are projected in the beginning of the movie \'Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit\' takes place mainly in the present. The film follows Jack Ryan, an economics student turned injured marine, on an adventurous journey to save America from a Russian businessman who plans to bring the nation down on its knees. Ryan\'s determination to recover from fatal injuries impresses William Harper. He beckons the youth to join the CIA. With his military career coming to a halt Ryan is skeptical about Harper\'s offer at first but eventually takes up on it. While recovering from his war wounds Ryan encounters Dr. Cathy Muller. Their meeting develops into a romantic liaison. Meantime while working at the CIA Ryan notices that a massive amount of U S dollars are being acquired by businessman Viktor Cherevin. The team suspects that it is to create a financial infrastructure. Ryan is deployed to Moscow to get to the bottom of the matter. Little does he know what he is really up against? The best moments One of the strengths of the movie is in its action scenes. One such moment which catches the viewers completely off guard is the conflict for survival which takes place when Ryan is escorted to his apartment. The bathroom brawl is when the action climaxes and Ryan makes his first kill. The next thrilling episode takes place when Ryan sneaks off from a dinner to raid Victor\'s headquarters while leaving his girlfriend to distract the gang leader. Such moments make us recall some of the best moments in successful action movies like the \'Mission Impossible\' and \'Bourne\' series. However the point when Ryan\'s Moscow driver tires to kill him seem to be almost a reproduction of that found in the \'Bourne\' series.  Chris Pine and Keira Knightley as Ryan and Cathy  Some of the camera angles deserve praise as well. When he is left with no option but to hold a stranger\'s head underwater, a close up of the remorse in Ryan\'s face is shown to imply that killing is new to him. This implies that he is more of a desk job individual rather than an undercover agent. Ryan\'s amateurish nature is finely captured and brought to the fore in this episode. It is presented in a convincing manner. However the action which later takes place in which Ryan acts like a professional is another matter. Such incidents portray Ryan as almost a clone of Jason Bourne. A unique character \'Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit\' has its share of lingering problems. Director Branagh does a double chore in casting himself in the movie as the chief baddie in \'Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit\'. The pressure of directing as well as acting one of the prominent roles seems to have taken its toll on him. Another actor who would have filled his shoes as Cherevin would have contributed more to flesh out the character. Kevin Costner\'s Harper is underplayed to boost Ryan\'s character further. It is questionable how Ryan managed to hide his status from Cathy since the movie indicates that their relationship has matured into a level that the couple seems to be in the brink of tying the knot. Yet Keira Knightley\'s Cathy seems to accept Ryan\'s absences till the point when the real action takes off. Only then does she questions him about his lies and learns the truth about the nature of his profession. Another glaring shortcoming in \'Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit\' is the lack of chemistry between Pine and Knightley. Knightley has shown great promise as a lover in movies like the \'Pirates of the Caribbean\' series and \'Anna Karenina.\' Therefore it comes as a surprise that she acts her role with such indifference. It is clear that she is used as an anchor for the protagonist. This is a pity because the director could have made more use of her talents. Pine may not have made a stunning impact as the lead character but he deserves price for giving the best of himself to the role. His efforts have made it a watch able production. \'Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit\' seems to be a solid outing for a re-Bourne hero but there is too much of the same old techniques for it to really stand out. Jack Ryan may not be James Bond or Jason Bourne but he is more of a mélange of these two rather a unique character. ',No

'Citizens\' MAIL - (24-02-2014)','President knows the way, and shows the way The Mahinda Chinthana is a thinker\'s opinion, converted to an ideology and conveyed to compatriots in the form of an election manifesto. It was authored by the Presidential aspirant, who was once known as \'Mahinda\' among the people, and today is the Executive President of Sri Lanka. In this booklet he turns over a new leaf every day diverting our attention to something new taking place somewhere in the country practically every day, ably and patriotically assisted by the duo, his brothers, Basil and Gotabaya, ab initio.  Bodies of terror victims, common sight before the President ended the war. We have experienced the peace and harmony that prevailed prior to some hare-brained waging an insurrection in 1971 and upsetting society. Since then, the upsurge of insurgency crippled the law and order situation to the worse, growing in a sequence to an insurmountable extent from 1983-2009 during which period the administrative machinery of the state pitifully malfunctioned. During this period in a completely disorganized atmosphere, people in disorientation were compelled to somehow or other save their lives and protect whatever was precious to them in whatever possible manner but could not be conformists as a result. For nearly three decades of this malediction, this way of life continued in suspense before the Death Knell. Those who were born during this period were also left to be grown in the same wild surrounding unattended, because there hadn\'t been anything else supreme for anybody to contemplate or concentrate on, other than living in fear, and saving their lives and of their siblings and offspring. Everybody was rendered helpless as the lese-majesties of the respective eras were under obligation to the terrorists, and the country was run according to their whims and fancies. This need not be retold as the citizens themselves have experienced what prevailed in those Dark Ages about which volumes have been written, millions of words have been spoken and are yet going on. The people now breathe in relief after President Mahinda Rajapaksa accomplished the impossible of defeating the terrorists on the day of reckoning, May 18, 2009. The government\'s prime responsibility in the aftermath was to recreate and rebuild the war ravaged areas, rehabilitate and re-settle the displaced mainly in the Northern and Eastern Provinces inclusive of the Provision of the wherewithal and whatever else needed to begin lives de novo. The next urgent challenge was to reconstitute the dehumanized and brutalized society during the nearly thirty year malediction. The operations to extinguish the 4,000 defeatists, to free the country completely from terrorism, to wipe out narco-terroism and bootlegging, detoxification of addicts and rehabilitation of dipsomaniacs, combat underworld operations, apprehend road hogs and jaywalkers and arrest multifarious unlawful activities untold, to restore law and order and discipline in the society and elevate to the standard it was prior to the thirty year catastrophe which befell the country. In order to fulfill this obligation which is part and parcel of \'Nation Building\' the President was compelled amidst usual criticism and protests by the malignant and the malevolent to create the Ministry of Law and Order too. The Thought for the Day by John C. Maxwell, in the Daily News of February 5, 2014, the diadem of the editorial says, \"A leader is one who knows the way, goes the way and shows the way.\" L.A.W. LIYANA ARACHCHI - KADAWATHA Toilet facilities at Dambulla During the period February 12th to 21st 2014, I visited the golden island of Sri Lanka with my family, and found that the people were warm and friendly. The country under its President Mahinda Rajapaksa, is a multicultural and a socialist democratic nation, and is a leader-model for all other South Asian states. The political leadership of Sri Lanka can certainly defuse all conflicting politics at the forthcoming Geneva conference, by proposing the formation of a South Asian Democratic Union. We visited the Rock Temple at Dambulla but were rather disappointed that whereas thousands of local and foreigners visit the temple daily, no proper clean toilets facilities were available at the site. Steps should be taken to fulfill this shortage without delay. DHIRENDRA SHARMA EMAIL Spelling mistake in English text I was going through the Lets Learn English Workbook Part - II Grade 3 when I came across the world \'papaw\' printed as \'pawpaw\' on pages 4,5,6,10 and 21. At first I took it as a printer\'s devil, but all the pages mentioned had the same spelling. It is a serous mistake on the part of those responsible for this children\'s book. It is also quite surprising how it missed the eyes of so many officials involved. NAZLY CASSIM - COLOMBO 13 Be careful even on pedestrian crossings On January 18, a man was knocked down on the pedestrian crossing at Mt. Lavinia. The driver had the audacity to take him to the hospital, but instead he was found dumped on the wayside. This type of frightful and inhuman scenario is becoming rampant on our roads and pedestrian-crossings, notwithstanding the wide publicity given against it by the Police and the mass media. One would think that the driver may have been an uneducated ruffian but in this case, he is said to be a senior manager of a leading pharmaceutical company. A few days later I was on the pedestrian crossing on the Galle Road near the Maliban Junction. While I was almost at the centre of the road, a car which came cruising hit my right hand, caused a heavy bruise at the joint, and the wheels went over my toes. It bruised my right big-toe severely. Both my legs would have been broken if I had gone half an inch further. It was just maniac driving. I suffered severe pain. It was a miraculous escape. The errant driver was seated in the car, until the police came on the scene. She never had the courtesy to get down and apologize to me, at least respecting my age. I did not want to make a police complaint because I am involved in a time-consuming project. She took down my telephone number but upto now, never inquired about me. She called herself a senior doctor at the Lady Ridgeway Hospital in Colombo. By her callous behaviour, she ridiculed her profession and family. I have been driving my car for the last fifty years with no pedestrian-crossing accidents ever. I think it is time for all pedestrians to be cautious of unrestrained and uncivilized vehicle drivers who make pedestrian crossings indeed deadly. RANJITH DODAMPEGAMA - RATMALANA ',No

'Leopard on loose triggers panic in Indian city','INDIA: A leopard sparked panic in a north Indian city when it strayed inside a hospital, a cinema and an apartment block while evading captors, an official said Monday. Authorities closed schools and colleges in Meerut, 60 kilometres (37 miles) northeast of the Indian capital, after the leopard was discovered prowling the city’s streets on Sunday, a senior city official said. “Despite our best efforts, we have been unable to track the leopard down. We have launched a massive hunt for the beast,” said additional district magistrate S.K. Dubey. The cat was found inside an empty ward of an army hospital on Sunday before wildlife officers were called and managed to fire a tranquiliser dart into it, Dubey told AFP.

AFP  “But despite that he managed to break (out through) the iron grilles and escaped. He then sneaked into the premises of a cinema hall before entering an apartment block. After that we lost track of the cat,” he said. Authorities have urged the closure of markets in the city of 3.5 million until the animal, which has left six people injured, was captured, according to the Press Trust of India (PTI) news agency. Police, soldiers and wildlife officials were trying to hunt it down but their efforts were being hampered by large crowds keen to catch a glimpse of the cat, PTI said. Photos showed the beast pushing its way through a lattice wall at the hospital as a policeman in riot helmet, stood ready to hit it with a baton. The leopard was also pictured leaping off a building site as people scrambled out of the way. Last week another leopard killed a five-year-old boy in the central state of Chhattisgarh, the latest in a string of incidents raising concerns about depleting habitats for big cats which is forcing them into populated areas.

'Maha Sivarathri:  Paving the way for eternal bliss','Of all the festivals devoted to the worship of God Siva, Maha Sivarathri is unique as day time fast and night-long vigil, cleanse one’s sins and pave the way for eternal bliss. The Sivarathri fast is the crest jewel among fasts. The agamas state that that Parvathi implored God Siva to bestow abundant grace on those who undertook this fast. It is observed in every Hindu temple and devout house, but it takes prominence in the temple of Lord Siva. It is notable that Thiruketheswaram temple in Mannar traditionally becomes the centre of attraction for the devotees for the fast and they flock in large numbers from all corners of Sri Lanka. The night which is devoted to Sivan (as the term Sivarathri indicates) in more important than the observances during the day. Lingam Worship Lingam worship signifying God Siva is prevalent in Sivan temples from ancient times. The Sacred Siva Lingam becomes the object of veneration on Maha Sivarathri night. Though God is formless, Lord Siva in the midst of night long vigil and sacred religious ceremonies, reveals Himself emerging from the Lingam in the form of a luminous light. The whole life process is imminent in Him. The sacred abishekam is performed for Siva Lingam with holy waters, decorating it with garlands and chanting mantra, repeating the words of Om Sivaya nama. The pooja ceremony is performed using flowers, specially with the leaves of Vilva tree as it has more meritorious effect. The first quarter of the Sivarathri pooja commences (Muthalam Samam) usually at 8.00 p.m. Lingam is anointed with sacred waters and for the poojs, lotus flowers are used for the ceremony one hundred and eight kumbams are used. The second quarter of the ritual commences at 10.30 p.m, for which forty-nine kumbams are used and for the pooja, thulasi leaves take precedence. The auspicious time most suited for the flow of Siva’s grace is mid night. As such the Linkotpava Pooja assumes significance during the third quarter of the night and at the climax of it God Siva reveals Himself in the form of a luminous light which is a rare gift for devotees. It is an elaborate ceremony where five kumbams are used with the participation of five friends. The fourth quarter (Nanlam Sawam) of the auspicious ceremony commences at 3 o’clock early in the morning and culminates at dawn. For the abisekam of Siva Lingam normal kumbams are used and pooja is performed preferably with Sengalinir flowers. The whole day and night is beneficially spent in temples. For the devotees to keep vigil, religious discourses, speeches and cultural programmes are organized in temples. These programmes synchronize with Linga worship. Thirumurai compositions on Lord Siva are recited specially on this occasion. In the earlier day the Sivarathri Puranas are sung. Later the chapter on the search for the crown and feet by Brahma and Vishan from the books like Kanthapuranam, Periyapuranam and Thiruvilayadal Puranam were sung and their meaning explained. Puranic Legend For most of the Hindu festivals, to elucidate the significance, legends are told. Likewise for Mahasivarathri the puranic story is as follows “On this day a hunter named Sivagossariar lost his way in the forest and he could not get back to his abode at night fall. So he climbed a Vilva tree out of fear of animals and was compelled to spend the night on the tree staying hungry and sleepless. To keep himself awake, he plucked the leaves and dropped one after the other. He not knowing that there was a Siva Lingam at the bottom of the tree, the plucked leaves fell on it. So unwittingly he had been fortunate to have worshipped the Siva Lingam fasting and keeping vigil the whole night. This illustrates that even if one slacks to worship God Siva, the almighty, amid the hurly burly life and worship Him at least on Maha Sivarathri Day with devotion and piety he gets divine favours. Philosophical significance The significance of Maha Sivarathri is deeply philosophical. The formless God Siva takes form out of compassion for the devotees, for otherwise they will be left in perpetual darkness without a guide. It is for this reason that the infinite impersona becomes a finite personal. This philosophy is really illustrated through Maha Sivarathri by which God Siva reveals Himself in the form of a luminous light, arising out of the Siva Lingam. To amplify this point further from Bhagavat Gita, where Lord Krishna revealed Himself to Arjuna, when the latter was perplexed. Self realization Man is the crown of creation. Animals move by instinct and they cannot go beyond that. But man can think and act and meditate. So it is a rare gift for having born as a human being and he has a purpose. That is to realize himself. The Greek philosopher Socratis said “Know thyself”. Gautama Buddha knew this and attained Nibbana. But it is not possible for each and every layman. It is here that festivals such as Maha Sivarathri takes importance as a guide in the spiritual life of self realization. Fasting prayers are said to have a tremendous influence over mind and body. The mind of a man who trains himself in thinking good, holy thoughts developes a tendency to think good, which eventually guides him in the spiritual path. As such Maha Sivarathri provides a unique opportunity for the layman to engage in prayers and fasting with full devotion to seek divine grace. The attributes of God Siva is described as follows in Thirumantiram Himself creates, Himself preserves, Himself destroys, Himself obscures, Himself all these, He does and then grants mukti Himself, The all pervading Lord. The Significance of Maha Siva Rathri T V Pereira Hindus celebrate Maha Sivarathri today. The day is devoted to the Hindu God Siva, the third god in the Thrimurthi, who is believed to have a third eye and is regarded as the destroyer and reproducer, with his abode in the Himalayas. Maha Sivarathri or ‘Great Night’ means the night most auspicious for worship and a great religious night most auspicious for worship and a great religious night concecrated to God Siva. The night is emphasized to signify the darkness of the world of senses in which man finds himself, while the endeavour is to pass from darkness to light, from night to day, and from the night to the day of deliverance. Maha Sivarathri, unlike other Hindu festivals is not celebrated with pomp and gaiety, but is dedicated to meditation and solitude, with rituals in Sivan Kovils being adhered to strictly. Fasting the whole day and keeping awake for twenty four hours occupy the centre stage. To spend Sivarathri night as a night-watch vigil, devotees engage in singing devotional songs and offering Poojas throughout the night. It is the Poojas which are held in almost every kovil as part of the rituals throughout the night that form the most important feature. The offering of flowers as well as leaves of the Vilva (Belli) tree as part of the Pooja, in addition to the fasting and praying is a specialty on this day, of which the night is all important. The origin of Maha Sivarathri is explained in several mythical stories, the most common which are found in the Puranas. The significance of Mahasivarathri is given in detail in the Puranic stories. The main story which is most popularly imparted to devotees, relates to how the supremacy of Lord Siva was established, indicating the origin and development of Sivalingam worship, and specifies that the final release of the human soul is attained only through love, compassion and devotion. It stresses that book learning and display of wealth through charitable deeds are of no benefit. Observance of religious rights on this day are believed to procure absolutions for the sins committed and release from the suffering of Karma and rebirth in the cycle of birth and death. One story in the Purana relates to a hunter who bagged a number of animals but had to spend the night in the dense forest. In order not to lose the game, he climbed a Beli tree to spend the night in it. This happened to be the night of the new moon in March when the nights are chilly and the dew falls heavily. To keep himself from falling asleep and slipping off the tree, the man began picking leaves and flowers of the tree and dropping them one by one. These fell onto a lingam which was at the foot of the tree, and Lord Siva was gratified at the homage paid to his symbol. Although the consecration was not pre-meditated Lord Siva decreed that the hunter should be rewarded. When the hunter died shortly after, Lord of Hell Yama claimed his soul as he had committed many sins by taking away the lives of creatures, but Lord Siva intervened and insisted that since he had fasted, kept vigil and offered pooja to the lingam during the night consecrated to Lord Siva, he had obtained absolution from his sins and deserved an honourable place in Kailasa (heaven). All stories have as the central and common theme, a sleepless and hungry hunter consecrating a holy night. The ancient and historical temple of Thirukatheeswaran in the Mannar district becomes a centre of high activity on Maha Sivarathri day. Pilgrims from all parts of the country, men and women, young and old visit the kovil to participate in religious observances on that night. The Madams accommodate the crowds but on the eve of Sivarathri night, the number of pilgrims is so formidable that it becomes a herculean task to provide shelter for all. Throughout the night, poojas are held and devotional songs are sung. In the morning, the images of Siva and Parvathi are taken in procession to the Palavi tank nearby for the water cutting ceremony. On reaching the tank, to the beating of drums, pealing of bells and blowing of conch shells and amidst cries of ‘Haro Hara’ men and women dip themselves in the waters and show their religious devotion by prostrating on the ground. A dip in the holy waters is believed to wash away the sins and purify the souls of the devotees. Sivarathri night is divided into four Yamas (quarters) and four poojas are performed during the four Yamas which signify the Mind, Intelligence, Heart and Ego. In each quarter the ceremonies of Abishekan Pooja and Siva Archaranam are performed. In the first quarter, the lingam is bathed in milk, in the second quarter in curd, in butter in the third quarter and in honey in the fourth. The next morning, the feet of the Brahmins are bathed first in butter, then in ghee and rose water. Hindus believe that if one observes Mahasivarathri rituals for a minimum of twelve years consequently, it would bring the absolution of one’s sins and karma, a reunion with the god himself in Kailasa and further spiritually benefit man’s progeny. Lord Siva is represented as wearing the crescent moon on his head and is also depicted in the pose of a ‘Panchakritaya’ dancer with five rhythms. The first rhythm of his dance is said to represent creation, the second maintenance, the third destruction and involution. Glories of Thiru Koneswaram Temple Chelvatamby Maniccavasagar Thiru Koneswaram temple in Trincomalee is a historical and ancient Iswaram and has attracted thousands of pilgrims from across Asia. This temple as a sacred place of Hindu worship of the ancient past would have remained in its original form up to the present day, had not the misguided zeal of the Portuguese caused it to be razed to the ground to procure building materials for their new fortifications which they built on the rock by the cliff and overlooking the deep blue sea. Further, there is a legendary story about Koneswaram temple. A Portuguese solider once entered the sanctum (Shrine Room) and defiled it by his presence as he was drunk and carrying a piece of roasted beef in his hand. The Wrath of God having fallen as for his unholy behaviour in desecrating the holy place, he had fallen accidently into the sea below and drowned. It is said that the dead soldier’s apparition could still be seen when the priest, after pooja, holds his torch over the edge of the precipice as and when night falls. Further Thiru Koneswaram was flourishing as a great centre of Saiva worship and religious songs were sung in honour of its presiding Deity by the Saiva Saint Thirugnana Sampanthar in the 7th century. In 1622, this shrine was attacked and destroyed by the Portuguese General Constantine de Sa de Noronha with the permission of the viceroy of India Don Tenonimo de Azevedo to build a Fort. He marched towards the Koneswaram Temple with the formidable army, destroyed the sacred edifice, threw off idols into the sea and on its site built a triangular Fort and fortified it with artillery. The required materials to build the Fort were collected from the debris of the destroyed temple. The Dutch, who drew away the Portuguese in 1658, demolished the old Fort and built a bigger one acclaimed as the most magnificent Fort along the Eastern Coast of the island. With the evacuation of the Dutch, it was handed over to the British on August 26, 1795, which they named as Fort Frederick the Duke of York (1763-1827) who established the Royal Military Asylum in England in 1801 for the sons of the English servicemen. The saga of this historical is said to have been described in a Tamil poem written by one “Kvirajah Varojayan”, an erudite and celebrated bard of ancient Sri Lanka. In the days of Yore, a king named “Manu Neethi Kanda Cholan” who ruled over the country “Chola Mandalam” came to know about the wonders of Trincomalee had come over the island on a pilgrimage as he was a devotee of God Shiva. Later his son Kolothunga Maharajah, having learnt about the holy place from his father, had come over to Trincomalee and built this temple. Recently, a book pertaining to the ancient history of this temple was released at the Sri Koneswara Hindu College, Trincomalee, presided over by the Trustee of Trincomalee Koneswara Temple Paramsothipillai Parameswaran. This Book was taken in procession from Koneswara Temple to the accompaniment of Natheswara music and devotional songs to Sri Bathra Kali Amman Temple in Trincomalee and therafter to Sri Koneswara Hindu College. At the entrance of the college Nanthy flags were hoisted in thousands and Trustee of Koneswara Temple Paramsothipillai made the welcome speech and several Hindu priests participated at this function. The Secretary of Koneswara Temple Board of Trustees K Arulsubarmanijam made the introductory speech of the book and the book was released by Judge Maniccavasagar Elanchelian. The first copy of the book was presented to secretary of the All Ceylon Hindu Congress M Kathirgamanatham. Indeed, Thiru Koneswara Temple in Trincomalee is a miraculous one and the launching of this book containing research articles, restoration of this temple after the rule of Portuguese, Dutch and British Administration of temple are of great value for the younger generation. ',No

'A Greener Environment','In the past year, various environmental issues came into the spotlight, rather frequently. From June to August 2012, we saw droughts severely affecting the North Central, North and North Western Provinces. This resulted in over 50,000 acres of paddy land being left uncultivated. It was also reported that there was a fall in the economic growth of the country from 7 per cent to 6.7 per cent within this short period of time. December 2012 brought with it heavy floods which hit 21 districts of the island killing 40 people and displacing 400,00 more. These may seem like events which happen every other year. However, one cannot ignore the intensity or the continuation of such extreme weather patterns which have rocked Sri Lanka and affected it in terms of both lives and property. What has changed over the past few years for our country to experience this? For this we may find answers in the changing quality of our air, water and soil and other environmental systems. The numerous and extremely important services we derive from these systems are not always obvious and therefore are sacrificed often to make way for the more conspicuous benefits of economic development. Focus on infrastructure is essential for a country to move forward in development. In fact, the word development is generally attributed to the provision and maintenance of stable infrastructure systems. However, development must be given a rounded interpretation. It should encompass policy changes on social welfare, access to the law and most importantly, the environment protection of the country. Sri Lanka being a small island, the importance of co-exisiting with nature cannot be over emphasized. The majority of the rural population of our country depend on either farming, agriculture, fishing or home industries for their survival. These livelihood activities rely heavily on the eco system and climate patterns of that particular area. In 1900, it was reported that we had a total forest cover of 70 per cent of the land area. The forests of our country are instrumental as catchment areas for trapping water, in maintaining the alkaline balance of the soil and in hilly areas holding the soil together, preventing mud slides. In addition tropical rainforests such as Sinharaja are only comparable to coral reefs in the diversity of plants, animals and micro-organisms they shelter. Forests are also considered the ‘lungs of the earth’, as they trap and sequester carbon dioxide, maintaining the greenhouse effect at optimal levels, and holding back the phenomenon of climate change. However over the past years this cover has declined rapidly and today it totals to a figure of 23.9 per cent. It is estimated that 40,000 ha of forested land is cleared every year, falling prey to development activities and the clearing of land for agriculture and chena cultivations. Illegal sand mining has been an environmental concern for many years in Sri Lanka. Sand mining of rivers results in sea water seeping into the fresh water of rivers, altering river ecosystems in ways that may take a long time to recover. As for the farmers that depend on such freshwater systems for irrigation, this would indicate disaster as they will not be able to cultivate crops with salty water. Transporting and mining without permits is illegal under the Mines and Minerals Act. In May 2012, the Environmental Ministry had brought new regulations to allow persons to transport sand without permits. The boom in the tourism sector had resulted in many tourist accommodation units such as hotels and guest houses popping up islandwide rapidly mostly along the coast. The story of the sea turtle is worth narrating as a good example of the impact of such unplanned development. For centuries, marine turtles have swum over to the sandy beaches of our island, to construct nests in which they lay eggs. Of the seven species of marine sea turtles found globally, five have been known to nest in Sri Lanka. More importantly, all five of these species are either endangered or critically endangered, as categorized by IUCN. It is said that turtles journey long distances throughout their life time and during fertile periods, return to the same beach they were hatched in, to lay eggs. However, many turtles die before this period and only a few return. When they do, it is to find their habitat taken up by hotels and disturbed by human activity. The tourism industry has also affected the farming and fishing community where agricultural and housing lands have been taken up to build tourist rest spots. This, in the long run will not benefit our country since such acts will result in the economic benefits not filtering down to the average man. The focus instead, should be on sustainable tourism, where natural habitats are protected and local communities become involved as well, so that they too share the benefits. Sri Lanka does not have strong environmental legislation. Few laws such as the Forest Ordinance and the Fauna and Flora Protection Act have been governing the protection of our environment for many years now. Lack of capacity, resources and know-how to adverse implement these laws, adverse political influence and not prioritizing this as equally important to other sectors such as health and education has resulted in the degradation of the environment. It must be recalled that as an island we are particularly vulnerable to the impacts of a degraded environment. The impacts of climate change such as rising sea level and more frequent natural disasters have already being seen. Other threats such as the threat of invasive alien species to our native biodiversity, depleting levels of groundwater and diminishing tracts of arable soil are starting to become prominent. It is a message that cannot be conveyed too frequently. Immediate and effective action to protect our environment should become a primary objective of every citizen of this country, if the environment we live in is to continue nurturing us into the future. At this point, it may be worth remembering something the native Americans recognized centuries ago. “We do not inherit the Earth from our Ancestors; we borrow it from our Children” Swasthika Arulingam AAL, Project Manager, Program Support Unit, Legal Aid Commission Questions and Answers  Computer crimes Question: Please let me know the law relating to computer offences in Sri Lanka. - Dinidu, Mahara Answer: There is no doubt that introduction of new offences to deal with computer crimes, application of new methodology to investigate and seizure of data in Computer hardware, software, communication devices, computer peripherals or any other forms and storing of them are important to deal with such offences. Its forensic issues and introduction of new laws relating to Computer evidence play a vital role in forwarding Evidence before Courts of Law. Computer offences may be; (a)Computer related offences – e.g. the accused uses the computer / network as tool/s to commit offences or (b)Computer integrated offences – the accused commits offences through computer programs (e.g. modification of computer programs by introducing computer virus, Trojan horse etc.,) or (c)Contents related offences – the accused changes/destroys computer data. Legal position on Computer Offences in Sri Lanka The Parliament of Sri Lanka has enacted the long awaited Computer Crime Act No.24 of 2007 that was gazetted on 13.07.2007 recognising Computer offences.

'Essence - (14-03-2014)','Crowds swamp church in Spain after ‘Holy Grail’ claim Curators were forced to remove a precious cup from display in a church in Spain when crowds swarmed there after historians claimed it was the Holy Grail, staff said. Visitors flocked to the San Isidro basilica in the northwestern city of Leon after two historians published a book saying the ancient goblet was the mythical chalice from which Christ sipped at the Last Supper. The director of the basilica’s museum, Raquel Jaen, said the cup was taken off display on Friday while curators look for an exhibition space large enough to accommodate the crowds. “It was in a very small room where it was not possible to admire it to the full,” she told AFP. Made of agate, gold and onyx and encrusted with precious stones, the object in Leon is formed by two goblets joined together, with one turned up, the other down. It has been known until now as the goblet of the Infanta Dona Urraca, daughter of Fernando I, King of Leon from 1037 to 1065. The two historians Leon University medieval history lecturer Margarita Torres and art historian Jose Manuel Ortega del Rio, identified it as the grail in their book “Kings of the Grail”, published last week. They said two Egyptian parchments they found in 2011 at Cairo’s University of Al-Azhar set them on a three-year investigation. Their studies led them to identify the upper part of the princess’s goblet, made of agate and missing a fragment as described in the parchments, as the grail -- one of the most prized relics in Christianity. It was offered to Fernando, a powerful Christian Spanish king, as a peace offering by the emir of a kingdom in the Muslim part of Spain at the time, Torres said. In Europe alone there are 200 supposed Holy Grails, the Spanish researchers admitted. They attempted to debunk the authenticity of some of the better known candidates in their book. Yahoo Yoga Poses for People Who Aren’t Flexible Part 2 of the gentle poses and helpful modifications that are perfect for beginners and those who lack flexibility when it comes to Yoga. Hold each position for 5 to 10 breaths. Seated poses can be held for longer, as long as you feel comfortable. Many people avoid yoga because they’re not flexible, but Carter says they are the very ones who should take up the practice! Yoga increases concentration, strengthens muscles, dials down stress, and can give you better posture. Before you get started, remember to maintain a smooth and even breath throughout the poses and don’t hold any pose longer than you’re physically able. You can increase the length and deepness of each pose with practice. One sign that you held a pose for too long is that you don’t have enough energy to come out of the position with grace and integrity. Chair Pose or Utkatasana This is a symmetrical pose, meaning both sides of your body will be moving in and out of the pose at the same time. It heats you up and strengthens the legs. How to do it: Stand with your feet together or hip-width apart if you’re stiff. Bend your knees (like you’re sitting in a chair) while raising the arms up alongside your ears. Modification: Chair pose can be challenging, so feel free to move out of the pose and into mountain pose on alternating breaths. This also makes it more dynamic. Tree Pose or Vrksasana This is a one-legged balancing pose. The pose builds confidence and can help to center the mind. It’s not easy to think about your stress when you’re balancing on one leg! How to do it: Stand on one leg and bring your foot up to your ankle, shin, or thigh depending on your flexibility. You can put a hand on the wall for balance or even stand with your back against a wall. If you feel very centered, lift your arms into the air to create “branches” for your tree. Shavasana Think doing nothing is easy? For many of us, especially those who haven’t tried yoga before, the concept of doing nothing is actually very challenging. This pose is both calming and grounding, and you can use it to cool down. How to do it: In this pose, close the eyes and attempt to just relax the body while lying flat on your back. Lie with your legs about hip-width apart and rest the arms at about a 45 degree angle to the torso, palms facing up. Allow your limbs to completely relax. Trainer tip: If you need more space for the lower back, you can place a folded blanket under the knees, which will help to lengthen the lower back. If you’re feeling stressed, placing blankets over the pelvis can help relax the body and the mind. Real Simple       Tech habits you should break now Some compulsions come from urban legends - that never shutting down your computer, for example, means never forcing it to make the processor-straining effort to turn itself back on. Others are fully unconscious, such as papering your PC desktop with saved files and wondering why it’s suddenly stuttering or crashing, or charging your phone whenever you’re near an outlet, and later complaining about your plummeting battery capacity. Here are some of the most common maladaptive tech habits, and the easiest ways to break them.    Compulsively charging your devices: The lithium-ion batteries in your devices are dying, one charge cycle at a time. Yes, each recharge essentially burns away some of the battery’s internal chemical processes. That steady march towards obsolescence can be slowed, though, by knowing when to pull the plug. Phones and tablets that get a compulsive, 5 percent burst of power from a car charger or workplace outlet still lose a full cycle, and laptops that stay plugged into the wall are steadily eating through cycles, while also heating those batteries, further shortening their life spans. To stave off the inevitable, charge devices to full, run them close to empty, and repeat. Never shutting down your computer: A computer that never shuts down is the equivalent of a compulsive hoarder, frantically piling disk caches, temporary files, and other digital garbage throughout its system. Putting the machine to sleep halts this junk-gathering process, but doesn’t purge it. To prevent your computer from gradually slowing under the growing burden of its own waste, simply restart or fully shut the thing down. Cluttering your desktop: Imagine if the messier your bedroom got, the slower you moved through it, the molasses-like pace decreasing with each discarded magazine or sock. That’s what happens to a computer desktop that’s cluttered with files, as the machine is forced to constantly index, account for, and generally expend processing resources on those items in plain sight. A slow PC can often see a huge boost in speed, as soon as files are swept off the desktop, and into folders. Avoiding software updates: Computers and mobile devices are now trained to nag, pinging the user with weekly or even daily requests to update loaded software. The instinct to ignore these is understandable and problematic - updates can not only protect your system from malicious attacks, but keep its various parts compatible with one another. If nothing else, commit to a weekly round of updates (for the low, low price, most likely, of a few minutes of watching progress bars). Never closing browser tabs: This one is simple - the more browser tabs you have open, the more work your device is doing. The effect is more noticeable on a computer than a phone or tablet, as forgotten tabs mount and the fans start to kick in (always a sign of heavy-duty processor activity), but even mobile devices tend to spend energy and memory keeping Web pages ready to view. To increase battery life and decrease stress on other components, kill old tabs.

The same goes for shots stored solely on a standalone camera’s memory card or a computer, but Smartphones are the worst offenders. Since transferring photos can be tedious and user-unfriendly, make backups a scheduled task, setting aside an hour every few months to copy files onto a dedicated hard drive, cloud storage service, or both. It’s aggravating, but far less than the alternative. Using Mapquest: Mapquest is the AOL of mapping services, a brand that once defined a technological capability, but now serves only to date anyone who uses or mentions it. Go for Google Maps instead, not because it’s the newer choice, but the better one, with more options for fine-tuning your chosen route, plus, for the free mobile apps (Android & iOS), real-time reports on accidents and road closures, as submitted by users of the Google-acquired service, Waze. MSN Living 3 Things to Know About Alcohol and Breastfeeding The message about drinking alcohol while you’re pregnant is pretty clear: It’s seriously harmful for babies, so don’t do it. But what about drinking when you’re breastfeeding? That’s way less precise. Tasha Adams, the 28-year-old mother of three was arrested for allegedly endangering the welfare of her then-six-month-old daughter after drinking while breastfeeding at an Arkansas restaurant. The details of the case are murky. Adams said she only had two beers over the course of two hours. An off-duty waitress at the restaurant claimed Adams was drinking copious amounts of hard liquor and that her baby - who is now 8 months old - was “getting fussy.” The waitress called the police who arrested Adams. But the officers themselves weren’t entirely sure what to do. Turns out drinking while nursing isn’t illegal in Arkansas. In mid March, the charges against Adams were dropped. The waitress has since been fired. Adams maintains she wasn’t doing anything wrong from a parenting standpoint. “I’ll say it till the day I die,” Adams told ABC’s 20/20. “I was sober enough to breastfeed my kid.” Drinking while nursing may not be illegal, but experts say large amounts of alcohol can be harmful for a breastfeeding baby. So are smaller amounts safe? And if so, how much is too much? That’s less clear. “It’s definitely gray,” says Catherine Herway, MD, assistant director of maternal fetal medicine at Staten Island University Hospital. There just aren’t enough good-quality studies to give us the full picture, she adds. Mothers of newborns less than three months old should be extra careful about drinking as the baby’s brain is still developing and very vulnerable, says Beth Conover, a nurse practitioner at the University of Nebraska Medical Center in Omaha and a member of the board of directors of MotherToBaby, a non-profit organization that provides information to mothers and healthcare professionals about alcohol and medication exposure during pregnancy and breastfeeding. Studies have also shown that when there’s alcohol in breast milk, babies drink less and may not grow as well, Dr. Herway says. One study found that when mothers had more than one drink daily during breastfeeding their babies had impaired motor development (but not mental development) at age 1, though a later study did not duplicate that finding. And it’s an old wive’s tale that a small amount of alcohol can actually help milk letdown, or the release of milk. The American Academy of Pediatrics says alcohol is not a galactagogue, meaning it doesn’t improve milk production or milk letdown. However, several studies have shown that drinking beer can increase levels of the hormone prolactin, which helps in the creation of breast milk. Researchers note that polysaccharides from barley and hops are responsible—so non-alcoholic beer has the same effect. That said, there are ways to drink responsibly without endangering your baby. Here are three things you need to know about alcohol and nursing. Less Is More: Breastfeeding or not, women and men should not drink more than the amounts recommended by leading health organizations, Conover says. For women, that’s one drink per day. The American Academy of Pediatrics policy on breastfeeding says that while alcohol intake should be limited, an occasional drink is acceptable. Specifically, the AAP says nursing moms should have no more than 0.5 grams of alcohol per kilogram of body weight, which for a 60-kilogram mother (about 130 pounds), is about 2 ounces of liquor, an eight-ounce glass of wine, or two beers. These measurements are slightly larger than “standard” drink sizes of about 1.5 ounces of liquor, 5 ounces of wine, or 12 ounces of beer. The AAP’s recommendation is based on what’s safe for the baby, not the amount that’s beneficial for your long-term health. Timing Is Everything: Don’t breastfeed your baby as you’re drinking or right after drinking. “If a mom is going to drink alcohol, she should wait at least three to four hours until breastfeeding the baby,” Dr. Herway says. (The American Academy of Pediatrics says to wait a minimum of two hours.) “The amount of alcohol in breast milk is very similar to the amount in the woman’s blood and alcohol is a fast-acting drug,” explains Conover. “It peaks pretty fast after you drink. . . It moves in and out of milk.” Alcohol could take longer to peak in some women, so pay attention to how you feel in addition to how long it’s been since you finished your drink. “If you’re still feeling woozy, it’s like the canary in the coal mine,” says Conover. “The alcohol level is (still) too high in the blood stream and in the breast milk.” Plan Ahead When Possible: If you know you’re going to drink and your baby will need to eat not long after, make sure you have some stored breast milk or formula ready to go, says Conover. “We get a lot of calls (from mothers) on St. Patrick’s Day and New Year’s Eve,” Conover says. “They’re calling because they’d like to still have a life and they want to take good care of their babies. They’re responsible.” If you do bottle-feed your baby after having a drink, you can “pump and dump” to alleviate breast pain that may result from skipping a feeding. Health.com ',No

'Michael Schumacher showing ‘small signs of progress’, says manager Sabine Kehm','Michael Schumacher showing ‘small signs of progress’, says manager Sabine Kehm  Michael Schumacher Michael Schumacher is “showing small signs of progress”, his spokeswoman said Sunday, with the Formula One legend slowly recovering from devastating brain injuries suffered in a ski accident. “There are short moments of consciousness and he is showing small signs of progress,” Schumacher’s manager Sabine Kehm told German broadcaster ARD. “There are moments when he is awake and moments when he is conscious, which make us happy and give us great courage. “Of course I am not a doctor, but medically, there is a distinction between being awake and being conscious, the latter meaning there is an ability to interact with his surroundings. “I don’t want to disclose details out of respect for the family, but we have no doubt at all in the abilities of the doctors treating Michael, they are experts in their field.” Kehm stressed that any interaction with Schumacher is “on a very limited basis” and added that “a medical prognosis is not possible” due to the nature of his brain injury. Schumacher has been in a medically induced coma in Grenoble, France, since being badly injured in a ski accident on December 29 in the French resort of Meribel with his son and friends. Kehm said Schumacher’s family have been touched by a deluge of tributes and support from fans of the racing driver, but constant media speculation, particularly in German newspapers, has caused the family some anguish. “What upsets the family most is media quoting doctors who are not treating Michael and untruths are constructed from these,” said Kehm, who has been in Grenoble nearly every day since the accident. “It has been a problem when outsiders comment and it means we have to set the record straight, even when we don’t want to.” The 45-year-old Schumacher underwent two operations in the days after the accident to remove life-threatening blood clots before being placed into a coma. The family announced at the end of January that drugs used to keep him in his deep sleep were being reduced with a view to bringing him back to consciousness. In February, his friend and former Ferrari teammate Felipe Massa was quoted as saying that Schumacher seemed to respond to him during a visit. NDTV',No

'Ukrainian military seize airfield controlled by anti-government activists','UKRAINE: Ukrainian troops have seized an airfield in the city of Kramatorsk as part of a security operation against anti-government activists in the eastern part of the country. Activists claimed several people were wounded. Coup-imposed President Aleksandr Turchinov said that he received a telephone call confirming that the military has seized the airfield in Kramatorsk. Ukrainian troops approached the military airfield in armoured personnel carriers between the eastern cities of Kramatorsk and Slavyansk earlier on Tuesday, the people’s militia located at the airfield told RIA Novosti over the phone. “They started negotiating with the people’s militia, which is in control of the airfield. The shooting started unexpectedly. There are injured among the people’s militia, and there may be deaths,” they said. The activists who controlled the base said they were forced to retreat. However, the city is still under the control of the people’s militia, as they have blocked the entrance to Kramatorsk and are ready to defend the city, the activists added. “We were forced out of the airfield, but the city itself is under our control, we won’t allow [the Ukrainian troops] to enter,” one of the activists told Interfax. “There are about 60 units of armoured vehicles. They have been preparing for several days, and now they started to storm [the airfield]. The protesters blocked their way, they started shooting, there are wounded. Our people retreated. There are about 15 tanks, the other units are armoured personnel vehicles,” another member of the people’s militia told RIA Novosti. However, the aid to the head of Ukraine’s Ministry of Interior Stanislav Rechinsky said there were no casualties. He did not specify the number of captives, saying that “this information will come in the upcoming days” He added that special forces of the Interior Ministry Omega and of SBU Alfa took part in the operation.

'President to open Manmunai bridge in Batticaloa tomorrow','President Mahinda Rajapaksa is to ceremonially open the Manmunai bridge in Batticaloa tomorrow. The bridge which is the first east-west land connection across the Batticaloa lagoon, has been constructed through a 1,206 million Japanese Yen (close to Rs. 2 billion) grant from the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA). The 210m long bridge enables land access to markets and services on the east side of the lagoon where Batticaloa township is located, especially for the farmer community on the west side. At present, access between the west and east banks is by a small ferry. The area is affected by floods two to three times a year, during which time the ferry cannot operate, and people have to detour about 30km to access the other side. The new bridge also connects the improved provincial road network on either side of the lagoon, opening an alternative road link to and from Batticaloa town to other areas of the country. The project was implemented by the Road Development Authority (RDA) of the Ministry of Ports and Highways in cooperation with JICA. The Manmunai Bridge construction commenced in 2012, to mark 60 years of diplomatic relations between Sri Lanka and Japan. \"We are happy to see that the construction was completed ahead of schedule. We are also very pleased to note that this has been a very safe construction site with zero accidents or injuries. About 250 people of this area were employed by the Japanese construction company during the construction, in line with Japan\'s ODA policy of contributing to improving the living standards of the people of recipient countries.

'Korea investigates capsized ferry crew as rescue hampered by tides','KOREA: Strong tides and murky waters off South Korea\'s southwest coast were hampering efforts on Friday to find survivors from a ferry accident over 48 hours previously that left hundreds of passengers missing, most of them high school students. Local media said the Sewol ferry may have made a sharp turn during its journey on Wednesday, which caused its cargo to shift and the boat to list sharply and begin to sink. Investigators declined to comment on the reports. Twenty eight passengers are officially listed as dead, 179 have been rescued and 268 are missing, presumed trapped in the stricken vessel, out of 475 passengers and crew bound from the port of Incheon to the holiday island of Jeju. Many of the missing are children from a school on the outskirts of Seoul and hopes are fading that any will be found alive. \"We cannot even see the ship\'s white colour. Our people are just touching the hull with their hands,\" Kim Chun-il, a diver from Undine Marine Industries, told relatives gathered near the site of the rescue effort in the port city of Jindo. Kim said that two divers had to return to the surface when an air pump stopped and said strong tides were impeding the rescue. Rescuers have pumped air into the vessel, but divers have not yet entered areas of the ship where many of the missing are believed to be. Coastguard officials have said the investigation was focused on possible crew negligence, problems with cargo stowage and structural defects of the vessel, although the ship appears to have passed all of its safety and insurance checks. The captain, Lee Joon-seok, faces criminal investigation, which is standard procedure in South Korea. Both the 69-year-old Lee and the company that owns the ship have apologised for the loss of life, although neither has admitted responsibility. Investigators said that Lee may not have been on the ship\'s bridge at the time of the accident and the vessel was being steered by the third mate, a normal situation on many ship journeys. The ferry went down in calm conditions and was following a frequently travelled 400 km (300 mile) route in familiar waters. Parents of the missing schoolchildren blamed the ship\'s captain for the tragedy after he and shipping company officials made emotional apologies for the loss of life. Some also heckled South Korean President Park Geun-hye when she visited the site on Thursday. HINDUSTAN TIMES ',No
'Is Sri Lanka the new Bali?','It’s a small island off the south coast of India and it’s being touted as the new Bali. So what is it about Sri Lanka that has travellers sitting up and taking notice?  We spoke to Australian photographer, Lincoln Jubb, who recently returned from a trip to Sri Lanka, about why he thinks this place is so special. Why I chose Sri Lanka I went to Sri Lanka in December last year with my girlfriend. We went during the on season, exploring Negombo and Hikkaduwa on the southwest coast, Galle, Unawatuna and Mirissa on the south coast and then up to Ella for a few nights. We finished our trip on the east coast during the off season at Yala National Park for a safari.  Sunset over the Sri Lankan mountains. Source: Supplied I was originally inspired to go because my parents went to Sri Lanka back in 1982 when they were the same age as my partner and I. My Dad being an avid surfer showed me photos of uncrowded waves and spoke of the whole simplicity of the place. My partner and I have clocked up 15 trips to Bali between us and decided we needed a new adventure where there were waves, sun and amazing food without all the bulls--- of Bali. I had some friends come back from Sri Lanka who kind of roughed it and didn’t overly enjoy their trip so I made sure I did some research into places I wanted to stay and visit. We booked some amazing accommodation and stayed at some really beautiful places. The new Bali? The quality of waves are definitely better in Bali but in saying that the waves are less crowded in Sri Lanka and if you go off the beaten track during the right seasons you will score. I have heard people refer to Sri Lanka as Bali in the 80s. Once you hit the southern province you come across these amazing pristine, uncrowded beaches littered with palm trees that look like something straight from a postcard. The beaches of Bali just don’t compare. I find Bali over crowded, dirty and overly Westernised whereas Sri Lanka hasn’t been butchered by Western culture. Yet. (I didn’t see a single McDonald’s the whole trip). However Sri Lanka is expanding and becoming more of a place for tourists. Places like Unawatuna are massive tourist attractions with beach parties and nice restaurants on the beach. On the other hand you can go up into the mountains and not see a Westerner for days, it’s nice. I think Bali has become accustomed to the bogan Aussie tourist yet in my whole three week trip to Sri Lanka I think I met only three other Australians. Beautiful people  See elephants on a mountain safari. Source: Supplied The people are amazing and so so beautiful. You walk down the streets past the front of the stalls and you think you are about to get hassled like you do in Bali but the locals just smile at you and say hello. No pressure to buy anything from anyone. Everybody was so friendly and so hospitable. The service is amazing everywhere you go. One of my favourite things about the trip, besides the food, was how beautiful the people were. Surprises I think the thing that surprised me the most was how much I enjoyed the place and how big the country actually is. Three weeks was definitely not enough. My sister and her partner just got back after seven weeks and still only explored the mountains and south coast. I got some great waves but not amazing waves so I definitely want to go back again soon and surf some other areas. It’s affordable I’d say its definitely cheap. We stayed in some nice places but it was affordable. In terms of accommodation you get what you pay for. I’d suggest you do your research. The food on the other hand is so cheap and delicious. We were having the freshest seafood and delicious curries for nothing. You can walk down the street and have the best curry you will have in your life for $1. Beverages and shopping are also cheap. Is it safe? The most dangerous thing in Sri Lanka are the buses. We almost got hit by a bus on multiple occasions. Driving over there is scary — I’d definitely hire a driver as there are no road rules. We saw numerous accidents and many local people die each year getting hit by buses. I can’t stress enough how crazy the bus drivers are! Other than that it is super safe. We didn’t have any real incidents or run ins with anyone.

'Methodist Church Koralawella celebrates 125th anniversary','This article is based on an interview with Shirley Denzil De Silva – Parishioner of Methodist Church, Koralawella staff, St Thomas’ College, Mt Lavinia. On June 29, 2014 Methodist church of Sri Lanka will jubilantly celebrate her 200th anniversary while Methodist church, Koralawella celebrates her 125th anniversary. The first five Methodist Missionaries of Sri Lanka landed at Galle and Weligama on Wednesday June 29, 1814. Colombo was the headquarters of the mission and Rev W M Harward, a versatile and an experienced missionary was in charge of Colombo and the suburbs. Rev and Mrs Harward visited, Moratuwa often to preach the gospel. A small school was opened in the village of Idama, Moratuwa and English was taught to the children. The parents were delighted at the remarkable manner the children learnt English. Another school was built in 1825 at Egoda Uyana, Moratuwa and this developed immensely within a short period of time. Within three years a small congregation of Methodists described as charming natives raised funds to build a small chapel. This chapel was dedicated by Rev Spencer Hardy on July 18, 1932. The church at Egoda Uyana, Moratuwa is the oldest Methodist church in Moratuwa. Rev Peter Gerald De Zylva, better known as the Apostle of Moratuwa, was appointed incumbent in 1840. The foundation for the Koralawella – Methodist church was laid during this period. A girl whom the parents and relations thought to be possessed by an evil spirit was accidently brought to Rev Peter Gerald De Zylva, who prayed over her and promptly arranged prayer meetings for a week at her small cottage. The girl realizing her sinful state repented and accepted Jesus Christ as her Lord and Saviour. The girl’s family was converted and this incident brought to the fold of 30 non-Christians who had the honour of becoming the pioneers of the Methodist church, Koralawella, Moratuwa. This active group of people built a small chapel at Koralawella in 1844, and it was opened on May 1. A congregation of over 500 was present though the chapel could accommodate only 150. In attendance was the Chief Justice Sir Anthony Oliphan. When Rev Peter Gerald De Silva came to Moratuwa in 1840 there was nothing to distinguish from any other place in the island. But when he left in 1864 after 24 years of devoted service, Methodism in Moratuwa was deeply rooted. So much so, in Koralawella, large crowds gathered at Sunday services, open air meetings and cottage meetings. The small chapel built in 1844 was found to be inadequate to accommodate the congregation and also the members felt the need to build a large church closer to the town on Moratuwa. The present spacious block at Koralawella was purchased in 1871 for a sum of Rs 500 from W Elias de Mel. The stone laying ceremony for the new church took place on July 23, 1873. The country had just settled down after the problems of 1848, when coffee plantations started to fail. The climax of its failure was observed during 1870-1875. The economic problems of the country undoubtedly had serious effects on the progress of the building of the new church. The work had to stop for a considerable period of time due to lack of funds. It took 14 years to complete the church and it was finally dedicated to the Glory of God at a simple ceremony on April 22, 1889 which was Easter Monday. Rev John Scot was the Guest of Honour at this ceremony. The total cost of building the church was less than Rs 3,000. Rev J A De Mel, who was from Koralawella, took great pains to make this dream come true and was quite fittingly appointed as the first Minister in charge of this new church. On April 22, 2014, Methodist church, Koralawella celebrates her 125th anniversary compared to the past years there is a considerable growth in the number coming for worship. Therefore a need of a new church for the increasing number of people has arisen. The members of our church eagerly and prayerfully await the building of their new church. The Kingdom of the Lord reigns forever may, the Methodist church, Koralawella too exist forever. ',No

'S.Korea mulls designating ferry sinking site as special disaster zone','SOUTH KOREA: South Korea is considering designating the site of the tragic ferry sinking accident as a special disaster zone to provide victims with the government-wide rapid assistance, the emergency management headquarters said Sunday. Prime Minister Chung Hong-won will hold a meeting of related ministers Sunday morning at Jindo Island where the pan-government emergency management headquarters is located. Chung and ministers will discuss whether to designate Jindo and Ansan as special disaster zones as physical and psychological damages continued to grow among victims of the deadly ferry sinking accident. The 6,825-ton passenger ship, \"Sewol,\" capsized and sank off the Jindo Island, South Korea\'s southwestern tip, on Wednesday. The upturned ship carried 476 passengers and crew, including 325 students and 15 teachers from the Danwon High School in Ansan, a Seoul suburb, on their way to the resort island of Jeju for a four-day field trip. So far 49 people have been confirmed dead and 174 rescued, leaving 266 others still missing. The headquarters said the government-wide assistance should be provided given growing damages to the victims, especially family members of the missing who have gathered at an indoor gym in Jindo Island and waited for news on search and rescue operations. After deliberating on the issue, the areas will be declared as special disaster zones by President Park Geun-hye. - XINHUA',No
'Extending a helping hand for the differently-abled','Many societies conjure up unfair stigmas about the disabled, or rather the differently- abled, which is the politically correct expression used in polite circles. It is true that several people still have entrenched negative attitudes about the disabled, particularly when they are involved in their everyday lives, such as workplaces. Worse still is the fact that people with disabilities also face ridicule and are often treated rudely by certain callous members of the general public. Besides verbal abuse they are on occasion subjected to physical abuse. Treating people badly for their physical or mental impediments is despicable, to say the least. Whether intentional or accidental this type of behaviour is intolerably dehumanising. A difficult task \r\n \t\t\tDisabled due to an accident   \r\n \t\t\tA disabled person  \r\n \t\t\tBorn with disability     Make no mistake about it. Differently-abled people are not second class citizens. They have the same basic legal, civil and human rights as other citizens. They have the inherent right to respect for their human dignity. As full citizens, they are entitled to respect, equal treatment, and full participation in society. In this day and age when we do not condone sexism or racism in the work place or in any social situation, why should we allow prejudice against disabled people to continue. Too many often think of them as sickly, feeble and frail. Far from it, because many of those people rolling around in wheelchairs, except for some possibly temporary ailment, may be far healthier than the ones you see walking around. But why do some people behave in such an inhumane manner towards others who are simply human beings? Several people avoid mulling over the fact that some day they might become disabled too. Many believe that it’s something that just happens to other people. Wrong, it can happen to anyone at any time through a debilitating sickness or accident.   A ramp to facilitate wheel chairs    Others lack self-esteem or have problems of their own that make them depressed and inferior. So they believe that that ill-treating others will somehow give themselves an ego boost or draw other people’s attention away from their own shortcomings. That is why they search for someone vulnerable to hurt or humiliate someone who they think can’t defend themselves. Sometimes they pick on are the ones with disabilities. Living within our society can be a difficult task, and for those that have disabilities can face especially hard challenges. There are however acts to protect many of these people, and to accommodate them as well as their challenges. Ignoring people There are others who are simply incapable of empathising with people with such conditions and some don’t know how to act around them, which can sometimes make them behave disrespectfully, whether they actually mean to or not. And the offenders to be pitied most perhaps are those, for all their great social standing, who are in essence, just plain immature and ignorant, to which I am prompted to add the deserving alliterative, idiotic. Also certain misguided folk see any kind of impairment as a weakness and simply cannot deal with it. Why? One significant reason is because it reminds them that they too are vulnerable. Death and sickness hold a terrifying prospect for them and they would rather not be reminded about it. As such, interacting with a person in a wheelchair may seem like facing up to their own mortality. Many modern buildings provide special amenities for the differently-abled such as ramps to facilitate the use of wheel-chairs and restrooms designed specifically for those with special needs. Several older buildings are being revamped with entrance ramps and other conveniences to make smoother progress for such impaired visitors. Still it is not just the public infrastructure that needs to be more disabled-friendly, because it is equally important that people have to change their bigoted perceptions. Fortunately not everyone thinks that way. In this day and age attitudes about the disabled are changing, but seemingly but not as quickly as they should. Today the public has had to deal with the disabled on a regular basis, particularly after the end of a prolonged senseless conflict. Often, just by working with or getting to know a disabled person socially, is enough to dispel wrong ideas that they have about the them. Many from a young age were taught not to stare at people with impairments. They were told that staring was rude which is indeed true. Yet at the same time looking at someone in a normal manner and flashing a smile is sociably acceptable. Ignoring people totally is tantamount to avoidance and certainly not a nice way to behave. A few aspects But those days appear to be over with acceptance and tolerance being the new catch phrase. Educating the public, particularly children, on disabilities can help destroy stereotypes and misinformation people hold about those with disabilities. Thankfully, many children realise that disabled people are not some gruesome monstrosities or evil alien creatures. Clearly it is important that your child is made aware of a few aspects about people’s disabilities. Make it quite plain that someone with a disability should not be feared in any way. Make them understand that one is either born with a disability or you acquire it through sickness or an accident. And more important: Disabilities are not contagious. You would have realised by now that people with disabilities are entitled to the same courtesies you would extend to anyone. That includes their personal privacy. If you find it inappropriate to ask people about their sex lives, or their incomes, extend the same courtesy to people with disabilities. There are many different ways to be courteous to a person with a disability. The best way is to treat them as you would anyone else. Because people with disabilities are just people, and do not deserve or need to be coddled or treated differently. Do not treat their disability as something to be pitied or ashamed of. Certain psychologists believe that many sometimes feel uncomfortable around people in wheelchairs because they don’t know how to approach them. Another factor is that it is not always observable what their problem is. So sometimes people avoid this dilemma altogether by avoidance. If you would like to help someone with a disability, ask if he or she needs it before you act, and listen to any instructions the person may want to give. Treat all people with impairments as adults. Call a person by his or her first name only when you extend this familiarity to everyone present. Don’t patronise people who use wheelchairs by patting them on the head. Reserve this sign of affection for children. All of us have barriers that we have to overcome. You may not have a disability, but remember that it could happen to you. gdgasross@gmail.com. ',No
'Sewol crew actions “akin to murder” - South Korea President','SOUTH KOREA: South Korean President Park Geun-hye has condemned the conduct of some of the crew of the ferry that sank last week, calling it “akin to murder”. Ms Park said that those to blame would have to take “criminal and civil” responsibility for their actions. Divers are continuing to recover bodies from the ferry, as they gain access to more of the submerged hull.  A candlelight vigil held for ferry victims.  The death toll now stands at 64, with 238 people still missing, most of them students from a school near Seoul. Bodies are being brought two or three at a time back to Jindo, a southern island close to where the ferry sank. Police, meanwhile, have been given access to hundreds of messages sent by passengers and crew so they can construct a detailed chronology of the ferry\'s last hour. Ms Park, whose government has faced criticism over its initial response to the disaster, told aides that the actions of the captain and some of the crew “were utterly incomprehensible, unacceptable and tantamount to murder”, the presidential office said. A total of 174 passengers were rescued from the Sewol, which capsized as it sailed from Incheon in the north-west to the southern island of Jeju. But there were 476 people on board - including 339 children and teachers on a school trip. Many were trapped inside the ship as it listed to one side and then sank. Investigations are focusing on whether the vessel took too sharp a turn - perhaps destabilising the vessel - before it started listing and whether an earlier evacuation order could have saved lives.  Grieving relatives.  Details of the panic and indecision on the bridge emerged on Sunday, when the coastguard released a transcript of the last communications between the crew and controllers. In the transcript, a crew member repeatedly asks if vessels are on hand to rescue passengers if evacuation is ordered. The captain, Lee Joon-seok, has said he delayed the move for fear people would drift away. Mr Lee, 69, was not on the bridge when the ferry began listing. It was steered by a third mate who had never navigated the waters where the accident occurred, prosecutors said on Saturday. The captain and two other crew members have been charged with negligence of duty and violation of maritime law. Four more crew members were reported to have been detained on Monday over allegations they failed to protect passengers. It has since emerged that Mr Lee appeared in a promotional video for the journey four years ago describing the ferry journey as safe as long as the passengers followed the crew\'s instructions. Over the weekend, there were angry confrontations between relatives of those on board and police, after a group began a protest march. The relatives say they want more information both about what happened and about how soon the remains of their loved ones can be recovered. - BBC NEWS ',No
'Soprano back to school!','\'Kishani sings for Visakha: On the lighter side\' will be held on May 11 at 7 pm at the Jeremias Dias Hall, Visakha Vidyalaya, Colombo. She is doing a concert, which will add to her already amazing life. Dazzling, Glamorous and Vivacious are three words that describe Kishani aptly. A Soprano Opera Singer, Kishani Jayasinghe\'s motives are altruistic, as she is doing her upcoming concert for her school, her Alma Mater, which is Visakha Vidyalaya. All the proceeds of the concert will be going to Visakha. In fact it is all done for Visakha Vidyalaya. Kishani owes a lot to her old school and to her family and Daily News met up with her to discuss her concert and the journey which led her up to where she is now. \"I\'m doing a solo concert for Visakha Vidyalaya which is my old school and it is called Kishani sings for Visakha: On the lighter side. We thought we would make it all encompassing. I will be singing all night. It will be a combination of Opera, which is what I do, and songs from musicals, a couple of songs from the movies, just popular music really. It is music that is beautiful and resonates with people, just music that anyone can enjoy. It is in opera style, which is my style. I want to bring it all back to where it all began. Hopefully it will be interesting to all ages and all music lovers,\" said Kishani. Kishani has a fantastic team of accompanists who will be working with her. \"I have Soundarie David Rodrigo on the Piano, Sureka Amarasinghe playing the flute, Satish Casie Chetty playing the violin and Shamistha De Silva on the Cello. I call them my S Team because all their names start with S! We laugh about that because that is our little joke! Ironically they all start with S.\" Talented Kishani\'s has been blessed with an angelic voice and talent. She has been showered with golden opportunities, that she has made full use of. Life has bestowed upon her rare privileges. In fact \'blessed would be another title that defines her. She is the first Sri Lankan and one of the first South Asians to sing at the Royal Opera House. She is the only Soprano to join the world renowned Jette Parker Young Artist program at the Royal Opera House. The Jette Parker Young Artist Program at the Royal Opera House is a program for exceptional young artists. At any one time, there are only ten artists (this includes Singers, Stage directors, Conductors and Répétiteurs) on the Program which spans 2 years, with usually five selected each year. \"I auditioned with several hundred international applicants and was one of four artists - and the only Soprano - selected that year. It was a little bit of a dream I think I remember as soon as I got the phone call saying that I had got onto the program and they had taken only one soprano and it was me, I remember I couldn\'t believe it! I was so thrilled. It was one of those magical moments in my journey. Memorable time It was an amazing opportunity and a really memorable time for me. The Royal Opera House is a place where we all dream of singing at, when we were training to become Opera Singers. And the dream came true for me. I was a young artist in the program. The first day I stepped on that stage was a really unbelievable moment. You can feel the energy and the history of all the great artists who have performed, you can really feed off this energy and it is an unbelievable place and it was an incredible moment. And it was very special.\" Kishani made her Royal Opera House Debut as Chloe in Tchaikovsky\'s Queen of Spades. \"It was my first production in the Opera House and it was a beautiful role. I had my own piece, beautiful costumes and unbelievable artists to work with. The maestro was a world renowned conductor and it was a fantastic group of people. It was Russian and a new experience for me. We had wonderful coaches, who made sure we pronounced everything correctly. We worked with the dancers, costume designers, the musical staff, the conductor and all directors. So many people came together to create this one magical show! As a first experience it was unbelievable.\" It is difficult to imagine oneself in Kishani\'s boots as she has already had an amazing life. \"One thing about being an artiste is you get to work with the most unbelievable people. Conductors make the music fall in place and they are the ones who are sort of the genius of the masterpiece and bring all the qualities you want. I\'ve worked with so many incredible people such as Antonio Pappano, an amazing unbelievable man, Charles MacKerras who has sadly passed away, a very brilliant and incredible conductor, Nicola Luisotti and Bernard Haitink. Kishani shared some thoughts with the Daily News concerning her early years. \"I was there at Visakha from year 1 to 13. After Visakha I went to University, the plan was to be a lawyer, so I am a lawyer by profession. I did my LLB at the University of Nottingham and once I finished that, I did my Masters in Law (International Commercial Law) also at Nottingham.\" Gratitude It was during that time that a sequences of coincidences and accidents led Kishani to Pamela Cook. Every successful personality in this world has a guru, and Kishani is no exception. \"I started singing when I was in Sri Lanka, but the lady who really created me, who really honed my skills as a singer was Pamela Cook, because I never really planned to be a singer. Pamela cook passed away last year. It was a horrible feeling for me, and a very difficult time, because she did so much for me, and I still consider her my guru. She really created me and built my instrument, and she honed my voice into something that can deliver perfection. So Pamela Cook really is my guru. For me personally, Pamela Cook was the greatest teacher: Epitome of elegance, compassion, warmth, and professionalism and the most extraordinary mentor. Fortunately she lived in Nottingham. So we started exploring the journey of whether I should be a singer or not. So of May, it starts at 7pm and it is a Sunday and it will be in the school hall. All songs we thought we would give it a whirl and see!\" Gratitude is something Kishani feels as she reminiscences upon her years and gratitude is an endearing characteristic in her.  \"Since I became a professional singer, I haven\'t done that many solo concerts, since I\'m always travelling, working and I live abroad. I did one concert as a student which was one of my first Concerts. As a professional, four years ago, I sang for differently abled children. My theme for these concerts in Sri Lanka have been up to now- to do with children. I feel like I have got everything really for nothing. I got an amazing education having studied at Visakha. And I have had the best of everything. So this is really the place where I have to pay my dues. It is really the place I owe so much to. I was educated at the best, for very little or nothing. So this is really where I would love to give back. Visakha is a hot bed of amazing, talented, intelligent and incredible kids.\" There is a saying that no one is a self-made man. The same can be said of a woman! And individual success can be normally attributed to great families. And she hails from a great family. \"My family sustains me in life and strengthens me in life. That is one thing I don\'t have to think about. I\'m very blessed and very lucky to have them. This is a rare and unusual job that requires a lot of support, specially that I have two young kids now. Without my family I couldn\'t manage it or sustain it. My family is part of me and my kids need me, so you have to draw up a balance. My parents are extraordinary, and I am what I am because of them. They are balanced, generous, loving and kind. I\'m also fortunate because I have had a lovely childhood. My soul mate, the love of my life is an incredible man. He is wonderful and his parents are wonderful. You have got to live life to the full.',No
'An \'upside-down planet\' discovered','US: Like so many interesting discoveries, this one happened largely by accident. An astronomer has discovered an \'upside-down planet\' that reveals new method for studying binary star systems. A binary star system is where two stars are so close that their gravitational interaction causes them to orbit about a common centre of mass. Working with astronomer Eric Agol, Ethan Kruse, a doctoral student at University of Washington has confirmed the first \"self-lensing\" binary star system. \"I found what essentially looked like an upside-down planet. What you normally expect is this dip in brightness, but what you see in this system is basically the exact opposite - it looks like an anti-transit,\" Kruse explained. Using the planet-hunting Kepler Space Telescope, Kruse\'s discovery confirms an astronomer\'s prediction in 1973 - based on stellar evolution models of the time - that such a system should be possible. The two stars of KOI-3278, about 2,600 light-years (a light-year is 5.88 trillion miles) away in the Lyra constellation, take turns being nearer to earth as they orbit each other every 88.18 days. They are about 43 million miles apart, roughly the distance the planet Mercury is from the sun. The white dwarf, a cooling star thought to be in the final stage of life, is about the earth\'s size but 200,000 times more massive. That increase in light, rather than the dip I thought I would see, was the white dwarf bending and magnifying light from its more distant neighbour through gravitational lensing, like a magnifying glass, Kruse noted. \"The basic idea is fairly simple. Gravity warps space and time and as light travels toward us it actually gets bent, changes direction. So, any gravitational object - anything with mass - acts as a magnifying glass, though a weak one,\" Agol added. The cool thing, in this case, is that the lensing effect is so strong, \"we are able to use that to measure the mass of the closer, white dwarf star. And instead of getting a dip now you get a brightening through the gravitational magnification\", Kruse said. Gravitational lensing is a common tool in astronomy. - DECCAN HERALD',No

Investment Promotion Minister Lakshman Yapa Abeywardena: I present the two orders under the Strategic Development Project Act. The initial gazettes have been amended and published. As there was no public objection to them, we hereby present them to the House for approval. One of the projects which we consider today under the Strategic Development Project Act is an investment by the John Keells company. This is a renowned private company which runs multipurpose business ventures. We should encourage this type of investment. These investments will help to boost the tourism industry in Sri Lanka. The proposed \'integrated tourism resort\' is essential to our economy. It has been found out that it is none other than Chinese tourists who spend most during their stay in this country. We have to attract them to our country, and for that we need to provide them with necessary facilities. We gave 43 days to present amendments to the gazettes. Amendments cannot be introduced to the orders. Those should be presented in the gazettes. The Opposition is trying to create uncertain fears among the public. They are misleading the public. The Crown Company is the investor of the other project that we approve today. It is one of the largest companies in Australia. When there were public protests, the President heeded to them. We cannot stop the investments which flow into the country. We if do so, it will affect badly our economy. The Opposition gets no support at all from the public. The protest they organized yesterday was a virtual flop. If we are to achieve our target of 8 percent annual economic growth, we need a USD 4 billion foreign investment per year. Therefore these investments are very much needed and essential to our country. Deputy Chairman of Committees Chandrakumar Murugesu takes the chair Joseph Michael Perera (UNP): We have never said that we are against setting up of hotels under the Strategic Development Projects Act. What we are against is the putting up and operation of casinos in these hotels. Economic Development Minister Basil Rajapaksa: The first gazette was published on September 23, 2013. It was amended and casinos were excluded. I hereby stress that we will never allow to put up casinos. That should be very clear. Don\'t try to mislead the public. The amended gazette has not allowed for the operation of casinos. Joseph Michael Perera continues: Please do not mislead the House. Nowhere in the gazette has it been mentioned that casinos will not be established in this country. The Buddhist monks as well as the public have been deceived. We are against this move to legalise casinos and prostitution in Sri Lanka. The amended gazette was a word game. Tax exemptions should not be granted to such investments. Petroleum Industries Minister Anura Priyadarshana Yapa: It is ironic that the UNP which introduced Joshim\'s to our country, is now standing against casinos. The Opposition is trying to put the word \'casino\' in front of everything and discard the entire project. These are very valuable investments to our country. The UNP regime destroyed the local economy. It even discouraged local production. Other countries which followed a policy of industrialization such as Singapore developed rapidly. What I request from the Opposition is to stop generating a fear psychosis on these investments. Whatever government comes into power, foreign direct investments will be much needed. We need to develop our service economy. Our tourism industry has a huge potential. We need to give maximum facilities in order to support it. The Opposition is spreading false rumours with the aim of toppling the government. It is only a dream that cannot and will not be realized. M.A. Sumanthiran (TNA): The Chief Prelates of the country wrote a letter to the government asking to amend the gazettes on this matter. I do not think the intellectuality of the Chief Prelates should be demeaned by anybody in this House. The government should clarify clearly what it means by \'Service spaces with associated facilities\' which has been mentioned in the amended gazettes. Why could not the government exclude those enterprises which are known to be associated with gambling? The anxieties of the Chief Prelates and the general public are yet unfounded. Higher Education Minister S.B. Dissanayake: The Opposition members who spoke on these three gazette notifications coupled them with casinos which is baseless as they have nothing to do with casinos. Casinos were allowed to be introduced by the UNP government in 1988. They brought Jo-Sim to Sri Lanka. The \'One armed bandit\' jackpot was set up near schools, religious places and near Daham pasals. I wrote a booklet on casinos. I included photos of the then President R. Premadasa and his wife posing with Jo-Sim. Casinos were initiated at every nook and corner for a payment of one million rupees to the government. But President Mahinda Rajapaksa\'s government increased its tax to Rs. 100 million, which resulted in small casino centers closing down. Those were the places our ordinary people patronised and lost the little income they had with them. Now casinos have been limited only to a very few in number in the country. The President\'s view is to limit casino only to tourists. Our government will be able to increase tourists arrivals to 1.4 million from the current two hundred thousand. It is not as a result of casinos but as a result of a correct economic policy implemented by our government. We need 14,000 hotel rooms in the country for foreign tourists. They are now being built up. The UNP cannot stand these development projects. It was the UNP which initiated casinos in the country. The UNP issued licences to casino operators. This country\'s economic development rate in six percent. Now Sri Lanka in waking up. There measures are to develop the nation. Around 400 ships pass the Sri Lanka seas. They do not come to our harbours when there are no facilities for them. So don\'t be jealous on the development measures taken up by this government. Janaka Bandara takes the Chair Anura Kumara Dissanayake (DNA): Though members of the government say there is no casinos in these gazettes, that is not true. This is all about casinos and these gazettes include facilities for casinos. You impose tax on all commodities used by the common people and provide tax facilities to James Packers. Highways, Ports and Shipping Project Minister Rohitha Abeygunawardena: MP Anura Kumara Dissanayake spoke of traditions and the religious aspects of politics. But I question as to how many of you can have a pure conscious of protecting the five precepts in Buddhism. Nobody can boast of protecting at least the first precept of refraining from killing. But our leader President Mahinda Rajapaksa has been able to establish a government of such nature. I would like to ask who introduced casinos to Sri Lanka? It was the UNP government that introduced them at the commencement. They also introduced many other forms of gaming and gamblings in 1988. They were introduced by a person called Naina Marikkar. It was our government that introduced provisions to monitor casinos in the country. The UNP also introduced the jackpot which made innocent children addicted to gambling. We are introducing a mechanism to monitor casinos to protect our culture and traditions. When we introduce these mechanisms the UNP and the Oppositions stand against them. Why is that? It is because a rage of terrorism is in progress within and outside Parliament to devastate the economy of the country. It is the JVP which is solely responsible for this state of affairs. They urge innocent people to close factories that use Sri Lankan rubber as raw material. The innocent people do not know that there is an economic devastating terrorist among them. Now when factories are closed, prospective foreign investors fear to come to Sri Lanka. That is exactly what the opposition wants. The JVP takes money from businessmen for their political movement. The opposition goes to various persons and religious priests in search of ways and means to topple the government. But they have all been a failure. I clearly state that we do not have several leaders but only one. He is President Mahinda Rajapaksa. The opposition talked loud when the Sevanagala and Pelawatta plantations were taken over by the government. But now these plantation are earning profits. The opposition is silent on this matter now, as their eyes have been opened. Eran Wickramaratne (UNP): I like to bring to the notice of this House that none has been taken into custody in connection with the incident faced by several UNP members in Hambantota recently. Now, our question is, are these constructions meant for the tourism industry or for casinos and gambling in the country? The government members say that these hotels are only for foreigners. But I say that this is our country so our people too should have the right to go to these hotels as and when they desire. We do not like taking this country back to the era when there were hotels confined only to the \'white people\'. Lakshman Kiriella (UNP): The agreements signed with these companies have not been presented to Parliament. So it is clear that the government has something to cover up. Why cannot the government present these agreements to remove the uncertainties of the people? Economic Development Minister Basil Rajapaksa: The agreements signed earlier will be cancelled as the Gazettes were amended. The new agreements will be signed shortly after the approval of the House for the amended gazettes, and thereafter they will be presented to the House shortly. Lakshman Kiriella continues: The government has acted in a very irresponsible manner. If the agreements have not been signed with the companies as yet, how can the government say for sure that those would not include casinos? I would like to know whether the existing casino operators in the country will be allowed to open new casinos in the proposed hotel complexes. Health Deputy Minister Lalith Dissanayake: The UNP which killed Richard de Soyza is speaking about media freedom. The UNP which presented the 1988 Gaming Bill is now speaking about casinos. Their past acts are contradictory to what they say now. That is why people do no cast votes for the UNP. The UNP does not get public support. Even though the UNP says the investors do not come to our country we have received 101 service sector investments, 72 infrastructure related investments and 18 agriculture related investments. These are large scale investments. Among the 101 of service sector investments, 49 are hotel projects. We need to encourage these investors. Sajith Premadasa (UNP): It is said that a four member family requires a Rs. 49,000 monthly income to live today. However, 73 percent of the rural community, 53 percent of the urban community and 81 percent of the plantation community are unable to acquire this monthly income. The government should re-think whether the granting of tax concessions for investments is the priority of the country. There are needy people who should be provided with relief. Arundika Fernando (UPFA): Even though some segments oppose these projects, these projects will prove to be beneficial to our country. The UNP created the cause for a 30 year war. Today, the war had been ended and the country has been developed. The country has received unprecedented amounts of investments over the past few years since 2005. Deputy Speaker Chandima Weerakkody takes the chair Ajith Mannapperuma (UNP): The opposition would not oppose these orders if the gazettes specifically mentioned that casinos, prostitution, and other related enterprises are excluded. If then we could have passed these orders even without a vote. Nalin Bandara (UNP): The government has not mentioned what could come under \'associated facilities\'. The government has a hidden agenda in presenting these orders. Sujeewa Senasinghe (UNP): Some sections of the government itself are against this move. If these investments do not include casinos why cannot it explain it to its own members and get their support? The UNP brought the Gaming Bill to regulate the gaming centres which were existing then. That was not intended to provide any relief to them. Economic Development Deputy Minister Faiser Musthapha: Casinos cannot be associated with the gazettes presented today. These gazettes have mentioned nothing on casinos. Therefore, the attempt of the opposition to criticize these projects in the name of casinos is very unfair. This is another attempt by the UNP to discredit the government. The orders were approved. The House was adjourned until 1.00 pm on May 6. Traffic accidents down during festivity period Sandasen Marasinghe and Disna Mudalige Prime Minister D.M. Jayaratne said in Parliament yesterday that traffic accidents during the Sinhala and Hindu New year season had dropped by 467 compared with the corresponding period last year. He made this observation in response to a question raised by Chief Opposition Whip and acting Opposition Leader John Amaratunga. The Prime Minister further said that however, there has been an increase in the number of deaths by 11 this year, compared with the figure for last year. He also stated that the government has taken many short term and long term measures to minimize traffic accidents. Deploying policemen to control traffic round the clock, arresting drunk drivers, educating pedestrians and three-wheel drivers, paying special concentration on buses, cyclists etc are among the short term measures. Identifying areas where the accident rate is very high and introducing alternative roads, organizing conferences and workshops for drunk drivers continuously are among the long-term plans. MP John Amaratunga earlier making his statement under Standing Order 23(2) said that over a short period of 10 days over 80 people are reported to have died as a result of traffic accidents. Opposition distorts facts to gain political advantage - Dy. minister Sandasen Marasinghe and Disna Mudalige Investment Promotion Deputy Minister Faizer Musthapa expressed his regrets at being called by Opposition MPs as a Muslim promoting casinos, while he was promoting Sri Lanka identity over Muslim identity. He made this observations at a press conference held in Parliament and said that the Opposition members attempt to list him as a Muslim promoting casinos in Sri Lanka. He said that he is a Sri Lankan and not one providing religious identity. He added that powers have not been vested in him to permit casinos. The opposition distorts the facts to gain political gains. The Deputy Minister said that it was the UNP that set up casinos in 1988. The UNP introduced casino as a source of income and imposed a tax of one million rupees on each casino. He also said that it was this government that increased the tax to Rs. 100 million, reducing operations of casino clubs to four or five. He added that the orders being debated, do not contain the word \'Casino\'. These provisions are passed to attract foreign investors. The country has been able to increase foreign investment by 50 percent compared with last year. The Opposition falsifies matters as they cannot stand the developments taking place in Sri Lanka.',No
'[Legal Aid Commission] 26.04.2014','MEDICAL NEGLIGENCE Prof. Ravindra Fernando Medical negligence is the breach of a duty of care towards a patient which results in, by an act of commission or omission, damage or harm to a patient. This duty of care is owed by all professionals who hold themselves out as skilled in medical, nursing and paramedical fields. Medical negligence is established when four main criteria are satisfied. They are: The doctor owes a duty of care to the patient, there is a breach of this duty by an act of commission or omission, existence of a causal relationship between the breach of the duty and the damage or harm caused to the patient, and, damage or harm is in fact caused to the patient. For a successful action of medical negligence the plaintiff (patient) must prove that a duty was breached, and this was the proximate cause of the harm, damage or injury to the patient, which can be physical, mental or financial. This causal connection between negligence and the patient’s injury is difficult to prove in some cases of negligence and is generally established by expert testimony. There is no breach of duty unless the doctor has failed to meet the required standard of care. The standard of care and what constitutes a breach of that standard must be determined, based on the facts of a particular case with the assistance of medical experts. As Chief Justice Tindal in England stated to a jury, “Every person who enters into a learned profession undertakes to bring to the exercise of it a reasonable degree of care and skill. He does not undertake, if he is an attorney, that at all events you shall gain your case, nor does a surgeon undertake that he will perform a cure; nor does he undertake to use the highest possible degree of skill. There may be persons, who have higher education and greater advantages than he has, but he undertakes to bring a fair, reasonable and competent degree of skill, and you will say whether in this case, the injury was occasioned by the want of such skill in the defendant.” Therefore, in a case of negligence it is necessary to determine when and how a breach of duty has occurred and whether there was a failure to exercise a reasonable degree of care and skill. As stated by Lord Scarman, although the law imposes the duty of care, the standard of care is a matter of medical judgement. The onus of proving medical negligence rests on the patient. There are no special rules about the burden or standard of proof, although it is harder to prove negligence in many cases where complicated and sophisticated diagnostic and therapeutic activities are involved. The doctor, if necessary, has to rebut the evidence led to show that there ­was no negligent on his part. In certain types of negligence, a doctor may be prosecuted, not by the patient, but by the State in order to protect the community and punish the doctor. Negligent conduct of this nature is called “criminal negligence”. In criminal negligence, proof is required that the doctor was guilty of such ­culpable negligence amounting to criminal misconduct. If the treatment given to a patient is so grossly negligent as to be described as reckless, wicked or showing such disregard for the life and safety of the patient, it is criminal negligence. If his death occurs as a result of such treatment, a doctor may be charged for manslaughter. In such cases, it is necessary to consider firstly, whether there was negligence on the doctor’s part, and if so, the conduct or the act of commission or omission is characterised by gross ignorance of principles and practice of medicine, or gross inattention to his patient\'s safety. Once sued by a patient, a doctor has several defences. The main defences to be considered are: (A)?The assumption of risk by the patient.\r\n (B)Contributory negligence by the patient.\r\n (C)?Denial of negligence.\r\n (D)?Inevitable accident or misadventure. Only a fraction of medical injuries actually arise from negligence. Most injuries either a result from system errors, or are inherent risks in the practice of medicine. Compensation for such injuries, therefore, cannot rationally come from the tort system, which compensates only for errors arising from negligence Several countries have created no-fault compensation schedules for medical negligence injuries. For example, New Zealand, Sweden, and Denmark have replaced litigational together with administrative compensation systems,where patients who sustain unavoidable medical injury can apply directly,without an attorney, for compensation. An expert medical panel reviews the case and decides on compensation. The advantages in these systems are twofold. Compensation can be given to the patient even without finding fault or negligence. This broadens the scope of patients who are entitled to compensation, a fundamental improvement over negligence. Information from claims is used to analyze opportunities for system improvements. No-fault compensation systems are the most rational compensation systems currently available. As most adverse events are not the result of negligence, compensation is not tied to finding of fault. There is a great benefit to all stakeholders in such a system. Patients gain because a wider group of patients can receive compensation, a greater percentage of funds can go to them. Claims are processed faster than with litigation. Physicians gain because they are not being sued and can focus on providing better care rather than engaging in defensive practices. The state gains because data can be collected to identify system shortcomings to build safer systems.

The E- Diary is a new concept of the LAC which facilitates the updating of pending cases at all provincial centres and enables the Head Office to electronically monitor and manage the case load of LAC centres islandwide. Chief Justice Mohan Peiris, PC in his address, emphasized the necessity to expand the Monitory limits now placed on Legal Aid to the deserving litigants and the need for senior attorney’s, including Presidents Counsel to get involved in Legal Aid and voluntarily appear for the marginalized litigants to argue and present their cases in Court. Trevor Hublin, Director, “Office of Governance and Vulnerable Populations” – USAID, said all participants while gaining a good knowledge should do their best by society by rendering a service that does justice to poor litigants. The session proper commenced with a presentation by Judge of the Supreme Court Justice Shiranee Thilakawardana on the topic of “Sexual Harassment”. The lecture was very informative as it explained the current development of the legal system in this area and quoted from leading judgements and enactments in other countries which may be also followed in Sri Lanka. The next presentation was on the topic of “Role of the Attorney General on what a citizen ought to be made aware of,” delivered by Attorney General Palitha Fernando.

The next lecture was on the topic “Consumer Protection Act and related topics” delivered Sajeevani Kasthuriarachchi. This too, was appeared to be a very useful topic as it would have helped the participants gain valuable knowledge on various trade practices. A presentation on “Leading of evidence and cross examination in accident claims” was delivered by DSG Arjuna Obeysekara, with the assistance of Senior State Counsel Hashini Opatha. Since the LAC handles many cases regarding accident matters, many participants raised numerous questions which they faced in courts during proceedings in Accident Claims. On the request of many participants prior to the commencement of the program that a lecture on “State Land Law” be included, the coordinator’s invited Senior State Counsel of the Attorney General’s Department Ishan Ratnapala, who prior to his present posting was State Counsel attached to the High Court of Anuradhapura to the honours.

A workman is defined as “any person who has entered into or works under a contract with an employer for the purposes of his trade or business in any capacity, whether the contract is specified in writing or on an oral agreement, or whether it is a contract of service or apprenticeship or contracted personally to execute any work or labour”. The payment is calculated by time done, or work done or otherwise. The Ordinance considers ‘period of service’ as a continuous period which has not been interrupted by a period of absence from work not exceeding fourteen days. The law applies to Government Department and local bodies. In the case of workmen who are masters of registered ships or seamen subject to certain modifications detailed in Section 25 (As per Part IV of the Ordinance) However, persons working as members of the Armed Forces of Sri Lanka, other than those persons employed in a civilian capacity in those Forces, and members of the Police Force are not included under this Ordinance. If any worker contracts a disease that could be reasonably attributed to the type of work he/she is doing while employed in any process or contracts an occupational disease as described in Schedule III, such as Anthrax infection, poisoning by lead, nitrous fumes etc. Then the compensation can be claimed under the terms of this Ordinance. The Ordinance also provides for compensation to be paid to the dependents of the worker, in the event of his/her demise as a result of a work related accident or occupational disease. Part III of this Ordinance addresses the compensation payable in detail. The amount of compensation payable for injuries sustained to a worker is listed in the relevant Schedules under this Ordinance. Schedule I - addresses permanent partial disablement as a result from injury. Where the injury is not listed therein compensation will be computed proportionately with the loss of earning capacity. In the event multiple injuries are caused by the same accident, the amount of compensation will be an aggregated amount, but it will not exceed the amount payable if permanent total disablement had been the result. Schedule IV - addresses instances where death results from the injury and the worker was in receipt of monthly wages. It also addresses compensation for permanent total disablement as a result of the injury sustained. The maximum payable is Rs.550,000 in the case of death or permanent disablement. The workers need to follow the following procedure in order to claim compensation. Form ‘A’ titled Application for Compensation by Workmen must be duly filled in, giving name and address etc. of the applicant, date of accident, cause of injury, type(s) of injury, monthly wages of worker, date on which notice of accident was served on employer, etc. The worker in his/her application requests the Commissioner to determine whether he/she is considered a worker within the terms of the Ordinance, whether the accident arose out of or in the course of the applicant’s employment, whether the amount of compensation claimed or any smaller amount is due and whether the respondent is liable to pay such compensation as may be due, etc. [Telecommunications Regulatory Commission of Sri Lanka] Question : How do I make consumer complaints to the Telecommunications Regulatory Commission (TRCSL)?

'[Citizens’ Mail - (05-04-2014)]','   President Rajapaksa’s far sightedness in sugar industry development calls for a hurrah! These days Minister Lakshman Seneviratne appears to be the happiest man in town, narrating ‘A Tale of Two Companies’ whilst celebrating the achievements of the Sugar Industry Development Ministry, created by President Mahinda Rajapaksa. Naturally, as the first Minister for Sugar Industry Development in this country already inscribed in history, he is entitled to celebrate the Rs. 1.34 billion profit earnings made public, the outcome of his efforts of course, with the unreserved co-operation of all in it, from the top drawer to the lowest rungs at such a short duration, when all the others who were in this field prior to him for more than 75 years have miserably failed. It also came as a panacea for him to cure the heartburn he suffered when he was mocked at by the adversary many a time and embitterment cast after he assumed duties in this newest portfolio. Tears yesterday for him today, is a joie de vivre – a great enjoyment of life. In 2011, the Economic Development Ministry identified 37 statutory establishments as unprofitably managed and underutilized, some deceased like the Jute Corporation at Hunupitiya, the name of which is but still seen on a hanging remnant above the Hunupitiya Railway Station like a Parakramabahu day Shilalipiya. The ministry\'s action was fast and furious that its first and foremost step was to vest in the state what was sold out, to revive with the rest of the sinking ones. A legislative enactment cited as ‘Revival of Under-performing or Under-utilized Enterprises’ came into being in 2011, as a result. The Sevanagala Sugar Industries which was part and parcel of the now defunct Sri Lanka Sugar Corporation, having been sold for a song and come to a standstill, was at death\'s door, and Pelwatte was sinking when Minister Seneviratne intervened under the provisions of Act No. 43 of 2011 on the direction of the far sighted President Mahinda Rajapaksa. Having re-vested these two establishments in the state in 2011 and subjected to a rehabilitation process, and reached the set targets, both industries have been able to earn a profit of Rs. 1.34 billion during 2011 and 2012 being the result of hard work, devotion and dedication not bluffing, history has proved well and truly. “Time will inevitably uncover dishonestly and lies; history has no place for them” Norodom Sihanouk in the \'Thought for the day\', the diadem of the Daily News Editorial of March 10, 2014. L.A.W. LIYANA ARACHCHI , KADAWATHA Why is Kandy Veterinary Teaching Hospital so callous? We took an ownerless dog that we named Kalu, with an oozing and enlarged front paw to the Veterinary Teaching Hospital (VTH) Faculty of Veterinary Science, Peradeniya University on February 17, 2014 after getting prior approval from a senior VTH vet surgeon. Kalu\'s infected stump was amputated on February 19, but on the 21st we found her in the Isolation Unit (IU) where dogs with conditions like distemper (a contagious disease) are kept which exposed Kalu to the virus. On inquiring as to why she was put there after major surgery, we were absurdly told that there was no room in her original Ward 7. We wanted to remove Kalu from the VTH but a senior clinician promised that they will look after her. Kalu was then brought from the IU in which we saw a wild boar and a very sick dog warded, to the Continuous Monitoring Unit. A few days later she was back in ward 7 but subjected to abject neglect. Once a dog is warded a VTH clinician should take charge of the \'patient\' along with a student. On March 14, Kalu was not eating, her surgery wound was oozing, the pus from it was all over her torso and she smelt. She had several fresh surface skin wounds, a yellow discharge from her nose and a wheeze-like sound in her chest. No one had attended on her till we ourselves brought her to the VTH OPD. We admitted the dog to another veterinary care facility, where they treated her for distemper and also the neglected surgical wound. By the next day the wound was drying up, but she died on the 18th of distemper contracted at the IU. We complained to the Dean/Vet Faculty of abject neglect and callous disregard at the VTH and requested him to take up the matter with the faculty. For 23 days after surgery, Kalu\'s wound had not healed whereas it dried up within two days of proper treatment elsewhere. This is not the first instance that dogs we took to the VTH have been subjected to such neglect and disregard. A community dog named Batti, we took for sterilization as Exam Cases for students, at the request of the VTH died from asphyxiation as she was taken in for surgery after meals. Two other dogs we took along with Batti choked during surgery. The vet surgeon operated Batti but total neglect and disregard cost the poor dog its life and so much heartache for her carer and us. Though the postmortem of Batti said the cause of death was asphyxiation, the reason for her death was given as brain infarction probably to safeguard the image of the VTH. On Batti\'s death, the Kandy Association for Community Protection through Animal Welfare (KACPAW) informed the VTH of its many shortcomings and urged it to have them corrected. The KACPAW has cleaned, painted, and refurbished the wards at the old VTH building at much cost as the wards were not washed properly and the patients lived amidst worms and their own faeces for days on end. Rs. 1,000 is charged for a pet to be warded here which at times did not even have a brush to clean up. We, the members of the KACPAW provided everything from cleaning equipment to specially designed ward beds, food and water bowls, a washing machine, a rice cooker, even taps, hoses and garden tools. At the new VTH building the KACPAW refurbished all the wards, provided more beds at a further cost to ensure comfort to the patients, built a passageway connecting the wards and the main building costing nearly Rs. 300,000 and donated trolleys to take patients, an ECG machine with paper rolls, a Cautery Unit and even ward bedhead boards at a total cost that exceeded Rs. 1m as we wanted the VTH the only veterinary teaching hospital in the country, and the veterinary students to benefit. Sadly, we have seen no improvement in the attitude or the care provided at the VTH to dogs we take there for treatment. Many pet owners have expressed similar sentiments to us. CHAMPA FERNANDO , SECRETARY, KACPAW Punishment for traffic speeding should be severe The Traffic Police imposed a regulation recently, that motorcyclists on public roads should switch on their headlights during daytime as well, while riding. This was according to the police, to help prevent road accidents. However during the New Year festival season, there were many accidents which involved motorcycles. Were they not with their headlights on? Most of these accidents had occurred outside the Colombo City limits and the clear cause according to the police spokesman as quoted in the media was, speeding and drunkenness. The police have been successful to an extent in prosecuting drunk drivers but this cannot be said of speeding traffic offenders. The fact that the police is doing much should be appreciated, but punishment for speed driving seems to be not stringent enough. NAZLY CASSIM , COLOMBO 13 Stricter laws needed to prevent wastage A good amount of food stuffs go waste due to lack of proper storage and transport facilities. Even the private sector does not seem to concentrate as they should on proper storage. Packaging for transportation is much to be desired. It appears as if certain traders prefer wastage so that their balance stocks could fetch a higher price. An incident took place sometime back where a large stock of blood stored in the Blood Bank had to be discarded as it had been contaminated and spoilt. In any event, stricter laws should be introduced to prevent wastage. S.R. BALACHANDRAN , WELLAWATTE ',No

A Transport Ministry Spokesman said that talks between the Transport Secretary and Unions held last morning were successful where the latter had requested unionists to abandon their action for the benefit of the people. He said the union action would affect hundreds of thousands of commuters during the forthcoming Vesak holidays unless an acceptable solution is found. Locomotive Operating Engineers Union (LOEU) General Secretary, K.A.U. Konthasingha said that locomotive drivers had resorted to work-to-rule action on Wednesday following the recent train collisions in Pothuhera and Aluthgama. He said that authorities place the blame on engine drivers whenever there is an accident. \"Locomotive drivers are always urged to adhere to the safety rules. Strictly adhering to the speed limits by the locomotive engineers had resulted in train delays during the last week,\" he said. \"Most of the collisions were largely due to a poor signal system that will have to be rectified soon to ensure the safety of train crews and commuters alike. But, the engine drivers, guards and station masters were interdicted even before an inquiry was conducted,\" Konthasingha said. \"We hope that the authorities would take this situation into consideration and providing acceptable solution at today\'s talks,\" he further said. ',No

'Rafael Nadal wins Madrid Masters','Rafael Nadal won his first title of the European clay-court season as a back injury forced Japan’s Kei Nishikori to retire during the final in Madrid. The world number one led 2-6 6-4 3-0 when a hobbling Nishikori - who had led by a set and a break - pulled out. Nadal, 27, becomes the first man to win four Madrid titles and extends his Masters 1000 record to 27 victories. The Spaniard had lost in the quarter-finals of his previous two tournaments, in Monte Carlo and Barcelona. He will now head to next week’s Rome Masters before moving on to Paris at the end of the month for the French Open, where he is an eight-time champion. Nadal had sympathy for Nishikori, saying: “I’m sorry for him. When you suffer something like that, it’s really tough. “I suffered a similar situation in Australia this year. So I know what I’m talking about and how bitter it is, especially when you’re playing an important match.” Nishikori, 24, went close to causing a major upset in Madrid, only to injure his back during a service game at 4-3 in the second set. He had required several bouts of treatment during Saturday’s three-hour win over David Ferrer, but this time the trainer was unable to get the Japanese player back to a competitive state. Nadal, roared on by his home crowd, had been fighting hard to get back into the match after an edgy start under pressure from Nishikori’s attacking game. When the 13-time Grand Slam champion failed to convert four break points from 0-40 early in the second set, he looked on course to lose a third match on clay for the first time since 2004. But it was a trademark heavy forehand from Nadal that saw Nishikori pull up as he was forced to change direction in game eight, and from that moment the 10th seed was effectively unable to compete. “I am very disappointed about what happened in this final,” said Nishikori. “Unfortunately, I was hurting already and I tried to fight but Rafa was too good today, so congratulations to him.

'Watery grave for child','An eight-year-old disabled child fell into a well at Milleniya junction on Monday while his mother was washing clothes near the well. The woman jumped into the well to save her child. Nobody heard the woman\'s call for help. The woman and the child were inside the well for about 30 minutes. A neighbouring woman who came to the well to draw water, saw the woman and the child and called for help. The neighbours took the woman and the child to Haltota Rural Hospital where the child died . The inquest on the death of T.S.S. Thilakaratne was held at the Horana Hospital. A verdict of accidental death due to asphyxia by drowning was recorded. Moragahahena Police led evidence. ',Yes
'Why we became human?','About 14 billion years ago there was a Big Bang. A universe was created. After 10 billion years, the planet earth formed. It has been there for nearly 4,000,500 millions of years. Oceans, seas, rivers, lakes, ponds etc began to emerge. Life on earth began 300,500 millions ago in the shape of an Abiogenesis. At the end, it became the human what we are today. Why? I am a Buddhist by birth. Until I became a teenager, I attended Daham Pasala on Sunday and took compulsory Buddhism as a subject in my O-L exams. I have been listening to (sometimes just hearing) chanting of pirith at least once a week on the radio and when passing temples on Poya days until I arrived in the UK. I have listened to dharma desana. I know many of my contemporaries had the same experience. I still remember an incident during the LTTE war. A man took a swerved hand of a female bomb victim home. He took the hand to remove the gold bangles and rings. We will never forget the tsunami incident at Galle when two robbers tried to snatch the necklace of a drowning girl. Sometime ago, the wallet and the mobile phone of a Samaritan were stolen when he left them on the shore and swam to rescue a drowning person. There were also many instances of robbing victims of tragic incidents. Unfortunately there is a new culture of mobile phone recording. Instead of helping the victim, the mobile phones come out. Most are eager to record the incident than helping or taking the victim to the closest hospital. There was a time when people ran to the hospital carrying the sick or victims of tragic accidents on their shoulder for miles when there was no transportation available. Most of the people video record the fatally wounded lying on the rail track or middle of the road. there are also many to beat the driver or burn down the bus that met with the accident. There are no statues of Jesus Christ at every junction in the United Kingdom. There is no loud speaker connected to Sunday mass choir or preaching. People going to churches have fallen in great numbers. True, they value Christianity mostly in their hearts and minds. Although there is a culture of \'mind your own business\' there are still people who would help you in an accident or a similar situation. You will not see someone taking a mobile phone out recording a victim of a tragic situation. You will not see bodies or a crushed body of an accident victim in any of the media. Humanity, is exercised in a different format here. Please do not consider this statement as a commendation or a promotion to UK values. This is what I see. If the decreasing rate of moral continues in our society for 10 more years, it is unimaginable to figure out the outcome. We have 2,500 years of glorious history bound with Buddhism. Thousands of years with Christianity, Hinduism and Islamism. Every religion has its great teachings and values. A saying of Sathya Sri Sai Baba comes in to my mind now. \"If you are a Buddhist, be a good Buddhist. If you are a Christian be a good Christian. If you are a Muslim follow proper Islamism. If you are a Hindu practise it properly\". Remember, millions of years ago we were just a simple organic compound. Hundreds of years after the death we will be just another set of bones with no distinct reference to the race or the religion. So why not just live this short period of life in harmony. ',No

Nissan profits jump 10\% Nissan has seen full-year profits jump 10\%, boosted by better sales, cost-cutting and a weaker yen. Japan’s second-biggest carmaker said net profits in the year to end-March were 389bn yen ($3.8bn; £2.26bn), on sales up 20\% to 10.48tn yen. Nissan forecast more growth this year, boosted by sales in emerging markets of its re-launched Datsun marque. Japan’s carmakers have been helped by the weaker yen, which inflates profits repatriated from overseas.Last week, Toyota reported annual net profits of 1.82tn, almost double the year before.

BBC Kia unveils zero-emission electric bicycle in Geneva Popular Korean car maker Kia has unveiled the prototypes of two electric bicycles as part of the company’s commitment to zero emission propulsion, 70 years after it first manufactured bicycle parts in Korea in 1944. Powered by a 250 Watt rear-wheel drive electric motor powered by a detachable 36 Volt, 10 ampere lithium-ion polymer battery, the Kia Electric Bicycle (KEB) demonstrated to media at the Geneva Motor Show weighs 20 kg and has a top speed of 25 kilometres per hour. The ‘City’ version of the KEB is fitted with 28-inch wheels and a rear-mounted battery and has a range of around 40 km on a single charge, and recharges in four hours. The MTB version features the same drive train and power pack as the City, but has Rock Shock 100 mm front forks, a mid-mounted battery and 26-inch all terrain tyres. Designed and engineered by Kia’s Venture Business Development Team at the Namyang R and D Centre in Korea, the KEB features an innovative monocoque metal frame which looks like a carbon fibre frame but is produced by an advanced metal stamping technology and a robotic automated welding process, resulting in automotive industry standards of quality control, the company said. These production methods provide Kia with a greater choice of metals during manufacture, with metal stamping allowing the frame to be made up of aluminium, high-tensile steel and stainless steel. The two prototype Kia electric bicycles were made using a frame, electric motor and power pack manufactured in Korea, with brake and gear components from Shimano of Japan. Final assembly was carried out in Germany. In Sri Lanka, Kia is one of the most in-demand automobile brands today, particularly in the Sports Utility Vehicle (SUV) segment. ',No

Computer crimes in Sri Lanka Question: Please let me know the legal position in relation to computer offences in Sri Lanka ? - Sameera, Colombo Answer: The Information and Communication Technology revolution has introduced \'the Computer and Internet\' and they have had a great impact on most aspects of our lives during the past two decades. There is no doubt that the introduction of new offences to deal with computer crimes, application of new methodology to investigate and seizure of data in computer hardware, software, communication devices, computer peripherals or any other forms and storing of them are important to deal with such offences. Computer offences may be, 1. Computer related offences - e.g. the accused uses the computer / network as tool/s to commit offences or 2. Computer integrated offences - the accused commits offences through computer programs (e.g.modification of computer programs by introducing computer virus, Trojan horse etc) or 3. Contents related offences - the accused changes/destroys computer data. Legal position on Computer Offences in Sri Lanka The Parliament of Sri Lanka enacted the long awaited Computer Crime Act No.24 of 2007 that was gazetted on 13.07.2007 recognising Computer offences. Internationally recognised offences identified under the Computer Crime Act Part I of the Act explains the offences relating to cyber crimes. * Section 3 of the Act deals with \'unauthorised access to any computer or information held in any computer. This is called computer hacking in general. * Section 4 of the Act has introduced the offence of unauthorised access with an intention to commit an offence. Explanation to Section 3 and 4 states that the mere \'turning on\' of a computer is sufficient to fulfill access to any computer and it is not necessary to have unauthorised access directed at any particular program, data or computer, to access information held in any computer. e.g. Sniffing and Phishing. * Section 5 of the Act has introduced the offence of causing a computer to perform a function without the lawful authority (unauthorised modification or damage or potential damage to any computer, computer system or computer program) and it is immaterial whether the consequences referred to therein were of a temporary or permanent nature. Transmitting of viruses (a malicious program) from a computer to another or computer system to perform a function of such computer or computer system accidentally or negligently and cause that to function in a different way than the normal functions without the authority may be an offence under this section. Other offences under Computer Crime Act * Section 6 deals with offences committed against national security, the national economy, or public order by causing a computer to perform a function. Terrorist activities carried using computers will be dealt under this section. * Section 7 has introduced the offence of obtaining information without lawful authority from a computer or a storage medium of a computer. * Section 8 explains the offence of illegal interception of data. A Service Provider of a mobile phone connection who intercepts any transmission between such Mobile phone and another connection illegitimately, such person commits an offence under this section. * Section 9 of the Computer Crime Act deals with the offence of using (produce, sell, procures for use, imports, exports, distributes etc) of illegal devices. * Section 10 of the Act has introduced unauthorised disclosure of information enabling access to a service as an offence. * A person who attempts to commit the aforesaid offences under sections 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13 and 14 of the Act or who causes such an offence to be committed, shall be guilty of an offence. * Abetment and conspiracy to commit a computer crime are offences and explained under sections 12 and 13 of the Act. ',No
'Awakening of Bharat’s Kundalini','The nation has spoken. And how! Election 2014 will go down as a watershed in India’s history. It marks the awakening of Bharatavarsh’s Kundalini. This ancient nation is casting off its stupor, as it were, and rising to regain its lost glory. As in the case of yogic sadhana, the path ahead is anything but smooth; it is strewn with thorns, pitfalls and alluring distractions. However, the awakened life-force (Pranashakti) can overcome it all. We can expect not just transfer of power, but transformation of the State. The election verdict marks the first decisive step towards dismantling of the Nehruvian political order that has dominated our public life since Independence. Its consequences will keep unfolding for months, years and decades. While its immediate effects will be felt in the economy and politics, the more lasting changes will be felt in the social realm. The perceptions, relations and power equations among castes - forward, backward and SCs - and between Hindus and non-Hindus will change materially and we shall see a more cohesive and integrated society. The emergence of Narendra Modi as a colossus on the national scene is the first takeaway of this election. He has conquered through fierce fight every inch of the political space he occupies. He has displayed extraordinary sense of purpose, determination, stamina and political acumen. In a long and arduous campaign that took him to every corner of the country, he established a rapport with every section of society. Man of the Hour Narendra Modi symbolises change with a capital C. He stands for everything that the establishment detests and abhors. He is a Hindu, a nationalist and is neither ashamed nor afraid of acknowledging it. His modest family background endears him to the masses even as it puts off the likes of Salman Khurshid and Mani Shankar Aiyar. Unlike Vajpayee and Advani, he is not craving for respectability among sworn enemies of Hinduism by bending to win their approval. His style is not to confront the adversary, but make him irrelevant. He is incorruptible; he suffers no fools, tolerates no non-sense and can call a spade a bloody shovel.  Modi on the campaign trail   Among the courtiers of the Delhi Durbar, strongly interlinked by favours received and returned, Modi is the ultimate outsider. He is not beholden to anyone for any favours, and is likely to play with a straight bat in dealing with ‘practical’ people used to bend rules, bypass laws and manipulate others to have their way. In short, Modi is the Man of the Hour for a country yearning for change. Secondly, the political dynasty founded by Motilal Nehru is facing terminal and irreversible decline. The halo around Sonia Gandhi has given way to dark clouds of suspicion. Both her children have been shown up for what they are: semi-literate, arrogant, ignorant brats. All three suffer from an entitlement syndrome and have nothing to offer the people except empty pro-poor rhetoric and fairy tales of family ‘sacrifices’. Priyanka Vadra blindly apes Indira Gandhi in her style and mannerisms, without realizing that Indira has become an anachronism today. Also, the stupid and gullible Indian villagers have become smarter now; the young generation has no patience with non-performing dynasties. Power of the Hindu vote Thirdly, this is a vote for political stability. Unaligned regional satraps from J&K to West Bengal, Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu were salivating at the prospect of milking the new Government in return for their support. They are left high and dry, for their services will not be needed. Even NDA allies will not able to pressurise Modi as they did Vajpayee. Modi is no ‘accidental’ Prime Minister, and BJP has numbers to act independently of its allies. The decimation of the Leftist parties is in itself a cause for celebration. Last, but not the least, the secular-communal divide artificially created to isolate the BJP and garner Muslim votes will become irrelevant. Modi has broken the power of Muslim vote – or veto – by demonstrating the power of the Hindu vote. He has shown that a Hindu leader can come to power without wooing Muslims as Muslims, provided he wins over enough numbers of Hindus. This should be no reason for Muslims to panic. For decades, secularist parties have scared Muslims into voting for them by conjuring up terrifying scenarios in case BJP ever came to power. Muslims cooperated in this con game because it enabled them to exercise political influence far disproportionate to their numbers. They acquired a veto on certifying who was secular and “fit and proper” to rule the country. That trick was tried this time too. Modi’s response to this scaremongering was benign neglect, studied indifference. He refused to court Muslims as Muslims. He steadfastly refused to single out castes, communities and religious groups in his addresses. Instead, he sought support of all 125 crore Indians including Muslims for growth and development that will benefit all Indians, including Muslims. He made no specific promises nor held out any threat to any community. Elsewhere in the world, this conscious refusal to appease religious groups for political support would be regarded as secularism. In India, it is proof of communalism! That should tell non-Indians something about what passes for secularism in this country. Right thinking Indians Modi succeeded because Hindus who are (genuinely) secular by nature trusted him and decided to give him a chance. Modi’s strategy offers a refreshing contrast to Vajpayee and Advani. Both went out of their way to woo Muslims to win acceptability in the secular establishment. Modi made secularists’ certificates irrelevant. He dealt with casteism in a similar manner, by promising policies and measures that will benefit all, cutting across caste lines. His record in Gujarat clinched the issue. Naturally, he was reviled by leaders who have made careers and fortunes by dividing people on caste and communal lines. His glorious success inspires the hope that the divisive politics of caste and community will soon become irrelevant. The top priority of the new government would be the economy. Modi fought the election on the twin planks of change and development. He promised change from the corrupt, insensitive and incompetent regime unleashed by the UPA. But it is not a purely negative vote. The verdict is for development: for faster growth, creation of jobs, control of inflation. The new government will have its hands full. The UPA has metaphorically handed it a house on fire. Nor should it expect any comfort from the enemies - local or foreign. As Radha Rajan pointed out in these columns, communal riots, student unrest, insurgencies, disruptive AAP-like movements, jihadi terror attacks, tensions along national borders, bringing the national currency under tremendous pressure - everything will be tried to distract and derail Modi. But then this election has released positive energies of a giant nation. Mr Modi has the backing of all right thinking Indians. The stock market has shown that investors are willing to put their money where their mouth is. A vast array of technocrats is willing to offer their expertise to tackle knotty problems. The young generation is raring to make its mark. It is the dawn that has come, as it must after every dark night. May 16, 2014 will be remembered as the second Independence Day.

'Pillow makers at Sankapala yearn state patronage','Anybody knows that a price of a cotton pillow costs not more than Rs. 300 in the open market. But have you ever heard of a pillow manufacturer in Sankapala Village, Dematagala selling five cotton pillows to a group of pilgrims for Rs. 30,000. The pilgrims, a group of French tourists who were travelling from Colombo to Kataragama via Ratnapura suddenly stopped in the remote village of Sankapala, close to Nonagama Junction and the Udawalawe National Park. The Sankapala village is also located few kilometers away from the newly constructed Mattala Mahinda Rajapaksa International Airport. The foreign visitors requested the tour guide to stop at the village to see the rows of wayside boutiques where people sell cotton pillows. There were about 50 boutiques on either side of the road and almost all boutiques are filled with large cotton bags and pillows. The village is also called by people as “Pulun Gama” Villagers also sell hand made cotton fabrics and cotton filled jackets which are ideal during winter seasons. The French group was delighted to see pillows filled with cotton , may be for the first time in their life. The tour guide, a Sinhalese person inquired from vendors in his mother tongue about the price of a pillow. He promptly replied that a pillow costs Rs. 400 and also offered a discounted rate if more than ten are purchased. The tourists bought only five pillows and the guide paid Rs. 2000. The vendor was very happy over the first business for the day and plucked king coconuts from a nearby tree for tourists. An elderly female in the group , probably about 75 years felt sorry for the poor vendor for his kind gesture and offered him Rs. 30, 000. The vendor 67- year old Ranmuthuge Gunapala related this story to Daily News staffers and recalled how he sold five pillows for a sum of Rs. 30,000. The Daily News staffers too visited the village accidently on their way to Hambantota to see development of wayside business activities of people. Anybody who visits Kataragama, Embilipitiya or Hambantota from Ratnapura could see rows of pillow shops on both sides of the road in Sankapala Village at Dematagala. A long standing cotton pillow manufacturer P.G.S. Kumara said about 300 families in Sankapala Village are involved in the pillow manufacturing and selling business. He said he has been involved in the business for the past 20 years and earns a monthly income of Rs. 35, 000 and that was sufficient to cover the family expenses. According to another wayside shop owner 40 –year old Ranjith Gunathunga, cotton pillow manufacturers bring cotton from places such as Mahiyangana , Kalawana, Ratnapura, Elahara and some remote villages in the Sabaragamuwa Province. He said cotton cultivation is also carried out by people in few other areas, but the supply is continuously done by cultivators in Mahiyangana. The legend says that manufacturing cotton pillows at Sankapala Village has a history of over 500 years. During the colonial era even British families had visited the village on their way to ancient Kataragama or to Hambantota. During this period, foreigners used the Hambantota Port as their major trade centre. It is also said the cotton plant was introduced to Sri Lanka by the Portuguese under their rule here. The word Pulun in Sinhala for cotton was also introduced by the Portuguese. The Portuguese cultivated cotton for export purposes. An elderly pillow businessman in Sankapala Village and a father of six children , 74- year old Guneris Singho said his great grandfather was also a pillow manufacturer. He undertook the business from his father, the late Simon Appuhamy. He said he sells his products not only at the Sankapala village, but also to tourist hotels at Hikkaduwa and Bentota. “My products are sold by my children,” he said. He said unlike in the past, the pillow manufacturing business has now become a dying industry not due to the high cost paid for raw cotton, but because cotton is imported by tourist hotel owners from foreign countries. “The Government should look into this and take prompt action to stop the import of cotton, even in small quantities by traders from abroad, \'\' he said. He said his children do not like to carry on the business further , saying that this industry cannot be done without state patronage. Guneris is of the view that Government officials should visit the Sankapala Village and meet pillow manufacturers and discuss the problems they face. A pillow manufacturer in Dematagaha, 48- year old Daham Nayanajith said in addition to pillows, villagers manufacture cotton matresses and cotton jackets which can be used in the cold seasons. He lamented about the low state patronage for this industry and requested authorities to grant bank loans for them to develop the industry. He said many families need loans to construct their wayside boutiques, especially to attract many foreigners who pass this way everyday. A long standing pillow businessman, 52- year old Lalith Abeysekara said at least 70 percent of families in the Sankapala village depend on pillow manufacturing industry, but many of them face untold hardships due to low monthly income . He proposed authorities to make arrangements to stop vehicles, especially tourist vehicles in their village at least for a few minutes to enable visitors to purchase their products. A pillow businessman of Sankapala village, Nimal Ratnasuriya requested the owners of all tourist hotels not to import cotton pillows , mattresses, jackets and other cotton related items from foreign countries and extend their helping hand to local poor businessmen by purchasing their products from the Sankapala village. He said they are ready to sell cotton related products, such as pillows, matresses and even carpets at reasonable prices to tourist hotels. He also urged President Mahinda Rajapaksa to stop at least for a few minutes in their village on his way to Hambantota and speak to villagers about the problems faced by pillow manufacturers.   ',No

'Pataudi-Nawab of Cricket, fascinating package of essays','When I first read a short newspaper review recently of the book titled “Pataudi-Nawab of Cricket”. I quickly reached out to three leading booksellers in Colombo, one after other and also to my friend Rohan Kannangara (of Rohan’s) yet another bookshop owner in Liberty Plaza who has sourced me some rare books. But I drew a blank at all four. Finally, I asked my son in Melbourne to bring it along when he came over for his usual Christmas vacation this time. Wasn’t I delighted when the book was delivered to me two days before he arrived through Gayana Books, New Delhi inclusive of bookmark, with the apt print “if you desire a book we shall deliver it at your doorstep”. Published by Harper Collins, - Publishers, India, Pataudi – Nawab of Cricket has been edited by Suresh Menon a highly respected Indian newspaper editor. He was with the “Indian Express” and also authored, “Bishen Bedi, Portrait of a Cricketer, ‘Champions, how the world cup was won, besides an anthology titled “Sachin” genius unplugged.’ Cricket aficionados all over the world should be grateful to Menon for this splendid package of opinion and in-sights of a wide spectrum of cricket writers Cricketers and others from cricket playing nations, except South Africa, New Zealand Pakistan, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh. Sri Lanka never played Tests against Tiger Pataudi, since we entered the Test arena officially in 1983 and by that time Pataudi had moved out of the Test scene. However, we do have a long history of playing against Indian teams in unofficial tests before that era. But Pataudi captained the Indian team which lost to Sri Lanka led by Michael Tissera in 1964 by four wickets. I felt it a privilege to read these delightful and at times humorous tales from such a distinguished group of cricketing greats besides renowned writers on Cricket. Menon has quite rightly begun the treat by giving a family touch to the book. The “foreward’ is written by Pataudi’s wife who was alternately known as Sharmila Tagore, a descendant of Nobel laureate Rabindranath Tagore. She was a much acclaimed Hindi Cinema Star, who married the Nawab (which means the prince) (Pataudi’s ancestors were rulers of a small Indian state, before India gained independence from British rule). There is also an added sentimental dimension when two of Pataudi’s daughters discuss their late fathers’ sterling paternal quantities. (Pataudi died at 70 in December 2011). Twenty-five memorable narratives, (including the two by the daughters of a personal nature) take readers deep into a romantic period of cricket and of course “Tiger” Pataudi’s great exploits on the fields of major cricket playing nations of that time. The book is confined to 137 pages and is somewhat of a short though exciting read. Among other notable essays: The one titled “the Prince Charming of Cricket” by Vijay Merchant, a former – India Captain who formed an excellent opening pair with “Vijay Hazare. Tony Lewis whose essay is titled “Laconic Heroism’. Lewis captained England in his debut. The internationally reputed cricket writer Ray Robinson who refers in particular to Pataudi’s contribution to the unity that he forged in the Indian Test teams. Of the modern day greats who have contributed to the book is a short but a fine piece of writing by Rahul Dravid. There are also nice memory recalls by Robin Marlet (A contemporary of the great Jim Laker in the English Test side) and Noel Coward which relates to a conversation between Pataudi and Coward. Incidentally, Coward authored “Cricket beyond the Bazaar” which explores India – Australia cricket relations over the years. He has also worked for Bradman’s Cricket Hall of Fame” which is one of the world’s foremost archives of cricket. Pataudi’s history The book also includes some memorable pictures. One such is a youthful Tiger with the first Indian Prime Minister Jawaharalal Nehru. Another with the great Don Bradman and of course yet another with his beautiful wife. It highlights several unique characteristics of Pataudi like his princely origins, the Cricketing blood which runs in his veins – His father also the Nawab of Pataudi (Senior) played for Oxford University in 1929, 1930 and 1931 and average 93.38 runs in a single season. This is a record and stands unbroken yet and above all the great inner strength and will Patandi (Junior) possessed to resume his Cricketing career despite the loss of one eye in a road accident. How well he adjusted himself especially to face great international fast bowlers of that era is a remarkable feature of his career. Cricket in India – the beginnings Finally a bit of Indian Cricket history not in the book which some of our readers may not know. The business community in Bombay (now Mumbai) fostered cricket in India in a big way. In fact it was the Parsee community who first took to cricket in that vast country after the English introduced the game in the late 19th century. The Parsees, a small group of people relatively prosperous were very successful entrepreneurs. Among the early Parsees who played Test Cricket were Vijay Merchant, Farook Engineer, Polly Umrigar and Nari Contractor, of whom Merchant, Umrigar and Contractor captained India. Contractor’s cricketing career nearly ended in tragedy when he was struck by a bouncer on the head by the demonic. West Indian fast bowler Charlie Griffith. Emergency brain surgery saved his life but sadly put paid to his career. This writer as a young schoolboy has seen the elegant Contractor play in Colombo in the 1950’s. He has also seen Polly Umrigar besides Abbas Ali Baig some years later. During that lovely, peaceful era we were fortunate to experience, Ceylon as we were known then had only one major venue for international sports, the Colombo oval. This ground featured all major athletic meets too. I also had the privilege of seeing Bob Richard Olympic Pole Vault champion and the Commonwealth 400 metre champion Milka Singh perform at the Oval.',No

'Army Engineers Conduct Mine Awareness Programs in 55 Division','The Security Forces Headquarters Jaffna conducted a mine risk education program for teachers and schoolchildren in the 55th Division of the North -- to prevent accidents caused by mines planted by LTTE terrorists before the outfit was eliminated. The 55 Division Myliddy-based 10th Sri Lanka Engineers (10 SLE) conducted six mine risk education programs under the disaster mitigation project initiated by Security Force - Jaffna (SF-J). The six programs which covered all Grama Niladhari divisions in the 55 Division area were held from March 4 to 11. One hundred and thirty teachers and 1,566 school children were briefed during this period. Apart from lectures conducted in schools and public places, soldiers launched a door to door campaign to educate the public on mines and Unexploded Explosive Ordnance (UXOs). The aim of the program was to prevent incidents caused by mines and UXOs that might have been scattered in the 55 Division area where some of the fiercest battles were fought between the LTTE and Security Forces. Meanwhile, the Army is taking measures to continue its parthenium eradication project it commenced last week in Jaffna on the directive of Commander SF-J Major General Udaya Perera. The SF-J launched this eco-friendly project to eradicate the perilous Parthenium from Jaffna commencing at different locations under the supervision of Commander 523 Brigade Brigadier Athula Marasinghe. Parthenium, which causes dermatitis and respiratory difficulties such as asthma among men, oral diseases and even death to animals, grows so fast that it starts spreading its seeds after four weeks. It invades agriculture lands as well. This harmful plant, botanically named Parthenium Hysterophorus began to take root in Jaffna after the seeds were brought here by the Indian Peace Keeping Force in 1987 with their animals, fodder, vehicles and machinery.

'BP taken off Gulf of Mexico blacklist','US: BP said it came to an agreement with the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) that lifts a ban preventing the company from bidding for new US federal government contracts. The company had been barred from signing new US government contracts following BP’s involvement in the massive 2010 oil spill at the Deepwater Horizon oil rig in the Gulf of Mexico. An explosion at the rig in 2010 killed 11 workers and the mile-deep Macondo oil well then spilled more than four million barrels of oil into the Gulf, harming coastlines from Florida to Texas. BP said it reached an agreement “resolving all matters related to the suspension, debarment and statutory disqualification of BP following the Deepwater Horizon accident and oil spill. “As a result of this agreement, BP is once again eligible to enter into new contracts with the US government, including new deepwater leases in the Gulf of Mexico.” Under the terms of the “administrative” agreement, which applies for five years, BP has agreed to a set of safety and operations, ethics and compliance, and corporate governance requirements. In its statement, the EPA said BP must retain an approved independent auditor who will conduct an annual review and report compliance with the agreement.  An aerial view of the oil spill. Also yesterday, it emerged that Shell paid its former chief executive Peter Voser more than €26m (£22m) in the two years before he left in January, even though the energy giant was forced to issue a profit warning for his final year a fortnight later. The company disclosed that Mr Voser’s total salary and bonus pay package was €8.4m for 2013 – a period in which the group’s full-year profits tumbled by 38 per cent to $16.7bn (£10bn) as it suffered from stiff competition in refining, impairment charges on its US shale oil and gas operations, and costs relating to disruption in Nigeria. Although Mr Voser’s pay package last year was well down on the €18.2m he received in 2012, it brought his total remuneration for his final two years to €26.6m. In the first shake-up since Ben van Beurden took over as chief executive from Mr Voser on January 1, he announced Shell would cut spending on US oil and gas production by a fifth and redirect much of the remainder from shale gas into oil and “liquids- rich” shale. As part of the transformation, the group will also be dividing its business into 150 “performance units” across the world. These will group together assets – such clusters of oil and gas fields in similar geological formations – so that their performance can be monitored more closely. The units will not change the structure of the company but instead have been created purely as a means of judging performance. “With sharper accountability in the company, this approach will target growth investment more effectively, focus on areas of business where performance improvement is most required and drive asset sales from non-strategic positions,” Mr van Beurden explained. - THE INDEPENDENT',No
'Chevron posts Rs 2.53 b profit for 2013','Chevron Lubricants Lanka PLC recorded a dynamic performance in a high pressure environment during 2013. Releasing their annual report for 2013 Kishu Gomes, Managing Director and CEO said that during the period under review the company recorded a 12\% increase in profits posting Rs. 2.53 bn, up from Rs 2.26 bn achieved in 2012. The ability to keep increasing the bottomline progressively despite the challenging conditions, speaks for the maturity of its business strategies and its unwavering commitment to its sustainability agenda. The year 2013 marked 12 years of Sri Lanka operations without ‘loss time incidents’ - an enviable injury-free record - where no employee injured in the workplace had to forego a single day of work.  Chairman Farrukh Saeed The construction of our US$15 mn new blending plant at Sapugaskanda is in full swing and is scheduled for completion by October 2014. “While more competition may be good for the consumer it becomes imperative to bring about the right regulations and put in place a legal framework to ensure sanity in the market for fair play and to safeguard the consumers,”Gomes said. The re-branding and distribution of products by non-licensed players also continues unabated while ‘cross filling’, the filling of products to containers proprietary to other players thereby misleading the customer and avoiding duties and taxes to the government coffers in some cases. With the increased number of players that may enter the market in 2014, these issues are likely to get aggravated. Farrukh Saeed, Chairman said that these results were achieved in an increasingly competitive marketplace and a sluggish and stagnant industry is indeed creditworthy. The increased earnings and free cash flows generated, enabled the Company to pay four interim dividends amounting to Rs. 15 per share as compared to Rs. 11 per share paid last year, an increase of 36\%. The dividends and the appreciation of the share price year on year would amount to a total shareholder return of 38\%. ',No
'[Citizens\' Mail 19.03.2014]','When will this dangerous rail crossing be guarded? The railway crossing at Kirulapona on D.M. Colombage Mawatha, close to the Kirulapona railway station, is a deadly place where a serious accident could happen at any time. There is no barrier across the road here, just a red light. Anyone driving from the Open University side needs to come right up to the rail line to see if a train is approaching. By then it will be too late as the front part of the vehicle with the passengers will be gone. This situation has arisen because both sides of the road close to the rail line have been encroached on and unauthorized ramshackle buildings have come up. These structures make it impossible to notice an oncoming train unless one stands on the rail track. Many school vans full of children as well as other motorists use this road, which is narrow. This place is a virtual death trap. The authorities must look into this before it is too late and innocent lives are lost. HEMANTHA HETTIARATCHCHI\r\n NUGEGODA Captain Angelo Mathews to the rescue In the recent past, our new and young cricketers have performed well in international games. They faced numerous interviews which were telecast live. We have seen that at times they struggle in facing the presenter. We have also noticed that some foreign presenters who know that the player is not fluent in English, go on prolonging the interview. Whatever the motive is, why should we leave room for such humiliation? It is not a shame for someone to be poor or not fluent in English, as long as he is not an Englishmen. Yet, it is nice if the players themselves or SLC look into this matter and arrange for some way to improve their English knowledge. We should not blame players or leave room for them to feel small. Some hail from faraway places unlike in the past. At one stage it was only the Colombo elite who played cricket. Some way or the other, something has to be done by the player himself or the SLC. In the meantime, the team captain Angelo Mathews could appear along with the player concerned at the interview and help him and save loads of unwarranted embarrassment. We remember Mahela Jayawardena gracefully doing that when Ajantha Mendis was interviewed a couple of years ago, playing for Sri Lanka. That did not embarrass anybody. Not knowing to speak English is no shame, but speaking broken English is unnecessary. Captain Mathews should give thought to this and even discuss with Sangakkara and Mahela and look for a way out of this unwanted and preventable situation. Angelo, Mahela and Sanga can even take turns as translators when required. SHANTHI WIJEWARDENA\r\n KANDANA Bouquet for Immigration and Emigration Department My three grandchildren in Australia who have dual citizenship decided to apply for Sri Lanka passports once they arrive with their Australian passports. They were reluctant to bring their Dual Citizenship certificates fearing the risk of losing them. Therefore I made inquiries from the Department of Immigration and Emigration over the telephone and was provided all answers politely, by the Management Assistant. Being unable to travel from Matara due to an ailment, I made a written request to the Controller General of Immigration and Emigration, who provided all necessary facilities for me to receive copies of the Dual Citizenship in a matter of a week. I wish to thank the Controller General Chulananda Perera, the Deputy Controller Ilukpitiya, the Management Assistant Vindya Samarasinghe and other officials through the CITIZEN\'S MAIL column. My perception is that things have been made much easy, after President Mahinda Rajapaksa who rid the country of terrorism, exhorted that public servants should perform their duties with commitment and dedication. NANDA NANAYAKKARA\r\n MATARA Any citizen should have humanity A ‘Citizen’ is a person with full rights in a country. Rights can differ from country to country yet inheritance of rights should be legal. All nations need valued citizens but just being born in a particular country does not provide any value either to the person or the country. When Sir Arthur C. Clarke became a citizen of Sri Lanka, it certainly benefitted the country in many ways. At birth, any citizen is first a human being. Therefore, humanity is the quality that any citizen should firstly acquire. If the sense of humanity prevails in a person, he will be able to respect other citizens. ISURU ANDRADI\r\n ALUTHGAMA Another holiday unnecessary A women\'s organisation in the North had stated that Women\'s International Day which falls on March 8 of each year, should be declared a holiday. Considering the number of holidays we enjoy at present, another national holiday is unnecessary. S.R. BALACHANDRAN\r\n WELLAWATTE Why are Mt. Lavinia Traffic Policemen rude to people? I am a senior citizen aged 71 years and have been living down Templers Road in Mt. Lavinia, for the past 40 odd years. I park my car on the side of Templers Road when I go to the pharmacy to buy my medicines and also to buy my dinner. On February 24, at about 6.30 pm two policemen on motorcycles, one on an escort type vehicle with blue lights and the other on a traffic motorcycle, approached me. One policeman came to my car and requested for my driving licence saying that I cannot park on either side of Templers Road. He was very rude to me and acted as if he was arresting a criminal. My wife and another lady was inside the car at the time. I explained to the officer that I came to buy my medicines and my dinner, that I am a resident of Templers road for the last 40 years and that I habitually park my car on the wayside when I go to the pharmacy and to the boutique to buy my dinner. Furthermore I told him that there is no \'No Parking\' board in the vicinity and not even the yellow lines. He then shouted at me in Sinhala and told me that he can decide the law according to his wish. He continued shouting at me saying that he knows how I should be treated. However the next day and up to date, I see vehicles parked on either side of Templers Road at the same place. I wish to request the Officer-in-Charge of the Mt. Lavinia police station through the Citizens\' Mail column to please advice police officers to be kind and courteous at least to Senior Citizens of the country. RANJAN J. SAMARAKONE\r\n MT.

How to find the number of a lost deed QUESTION: The deed owned by my mother was lost 30 years ago and she has expired since then. She did not give any information regarding the said deed. The land in question is being used illegally but there is no constructions. Please help me to find out the number of the deed. - Chamara, Maharagama ANSWER: You have not mentioned where the land is situated. All the lands have been assessed by the relevant Local Authority and the owner has to pay rates to the Local Body. So please go to the relevant Local Body and go through the register and get the particulars regarding the deed and apply to the relevant Land Registry and get the certified copy of deed and encumbrance sheets, if necessary. You have not mentioned as to who pays rates to the Local Body and whether you still got to the land and maintain the boundary premises or boundaries. You are the legal owner of the land if you have the deed and the land is entered in the assessment register as yours. You have to find out whether the man who uses the land, as mentioned by you in your letter, objects to your entering the land. Otherwise he can always claim prescriptive rights in his favour against you. Gratuity payment to personal driver QUESTION : I am a Director in a Private Company. I have employed a personal driver who has been working with me for well over 20 years. I was paying his salary out of my own funds. He has informed me that he would like to retire due to ill health. Is he entitled to get gratuity under the Payment of Gratuity Act No.12 of 1983. Kindly advice me. - Lasantha, Colombo ANSWER: It is provided in Section 7 of the Payment of Gratuity Act No.12 of 1983 that – (a) If a workman is employed as a domestic servant or as a personal chauffeur in a private household or (b) Is entitled to a pension under a non contributory pension scheme. He will not qualify for any gratuity. The chauffeur concerned was paid a salary out of your own money and not from the Company. In addition, he is not an employee of the Company. He will therefore not be entitled to any Gratuity under the Act. If he has been a loyal worker, you are free to make an exgratia payment which is not a legal entitlement. Accident cases QUESTION : My brother met with an accident two years ago and broke his leg. The Magistrate’s Court case was over and the driver of the vehicle was convicted. A civil case has now been filed and the case is pending. While the civil case was proceeding, my brother met with another major accident and died on the spot.

'No Pain, No Gain ?','One look at Valeria Lukynova and you\'ll wonder whether she is real or a mannequin! This young girl from Ukraine has evolved into a living human Barbie doll. Lukynova is so obsessed with her resemblance to the Barbie by Mattel that she has literally transformed herself to look like a real-life Barbie! She holds the record for most money spent on cosmetic surgery. It is said that she spent over $ 800, 000 for the surgery to make her as perfect as the real Barbie with her impossible curves and vital statistics. Her pictures and videos that have been circulating on the Internet made her a sensation in April, 2012. Her videos have more than 16 million views.            Consultant Maxillo - Facial Surgeon \r\n \t\t\tDr Thiraviam Sabesan, \r\n \t\t\tSkin Clinic  \"Every slim woman looks like a doll. I won\'t deny I play with people\'s perceptions. I don\'t take the critics seriously. It is the price you pay with celebrity,\" states the 5 feet 7 inch tall Lukynova who is a new age opera singer, professional mountain climber and a teacher at the school of Out-of-Body Travel, an international school which shows students how to leave their physical body and travel in their spiritual being. Body Dysmorphic Syndrome  Beautician Nayana Karunaratne  \"There is an increased awareness and acceptability about cosmetic surgery in Sri Lanka now. However if a person does not accept the body that they have attained naturally we call that Body Dysmorphic Syndrome. A person can do a few adjustments to their appearance to look a little better as they age but I do not accept the attitude of completely transforming oneself,\"says Consultant Maxillo - Facial Surgeon Dr Thiraviam Sabesan, a doctor at the Skin Clinic, Bambalapitiya. Dr Sabesan specializes in brow lift, blepharoplasty (eye bag removal), face lift, rhinoplasty (nose job), otoplasty (ear surgery), orthognathic surgery (corrective jaw surgery), genioplasty (chin surgery), implants, botox, hair transplant and whole face aesthetic. \"Rhinoplasties are the most popular among our patients. Botox fillers and face lifts are also in demand. A majority of our patients are women. Out of 10 patients, nine of them are women. I have analysized my face lift cases. Around 60 percent need a younger look to maintain a healthy family relationship. Around 20 percent wish to look younger because their children compare them with the parents of their fellow companions. Another 20 do it because of job related reasons. The oldest patient I have worked on is 82 but she was in great health. Age is not a barrier to cosmetic surgery. Healths issues might be problem,\" he said. Plastic surgeries Plastic surgery did not evolve as a cosmetic procedure, but as a reconstruction procedure. In 600 B C Indian surgeon Sushruta Samhita conducted the first plastic surgeries known as rhinoplasties which involved reconstruction of the nose. It is only much much later that plastic surgeries began to be done on people who wished to look different or change certain aspects of their body. Even today most plastic surgery is not cosmetic. They are most frequently conducted on patients suffering from burn injuries and victims of accidents requiring reconstruction of body parts. Cosmetic surgeries include altering the size or shape of parts of the body and removal of fat from specific areas like in liposuction. Even relatively minor procedures like laser removal of body hair are considered a kind of cosmetic surgery. \"In plastic surgery you use the plasticity of the body tissues. We use that to shape the body. This can be cosmetic or reconstructive. If you wish to alter the appearance of one of your body parts that is cosmetic surgery but if you have met with an accident and lost a body part, then you need reconstructive surgery,\" Dr Sabesan explained.    He notes that the patient needs to maintain his or her hygiene conditions to reap the benefits of the surgery. Most of the surgeries have become painless due to using anesthetics. \"Cosmetic is not only a matter of looking good but builds up self esteem as well. It has an impact on the quality of their life. Their relationship with others improves due to enhancing their looks,\" he said. Laser tattoo removal Speaking about the laser tattoo removal procedures Dr T H Alahakoon, a Doctor at Skin Clinic, says that if the tattoo does not have any lesions on it and if it has not scarred, laster tattoo removal can be carried out effectively. The skin type, the colour of the tattoo as well as whether it has been done by a professional or at home too matters. \"A majority of our patients have gotten the tattoo at a young age. When they reach their 40s or 50s, they become fed up with the design. Sometimes they need to have the tattoo removed due to the occupation they choose,\" noted Dr Alahakoon. When queried if laser tattoo removal leads to ailments like cancer Dr Alahakoon said that this is a misconception. \"The world \'laser\' generates from \'light amplification by stimulated emission of coherent single colour and light.\' This is going to be absorbed by the targeted cells: the tattoo ink on a tattoo or the melanin pigment in the follicle during hair removal. We do not damage the epidermis (top layer of the skin) but focus on the targeted area. The possible side effect in this treatment can be caused to the eyes but when we engage in this treatment the patient as well as the doctor use eye protection,” she explained adding that birth marks as well as scars can be removed via laser treatment. Cosmetic surgery allegations “Lots of people visit us for laser hair removal as well as for hyper pigmentation. The cost depends on the number of sittings the person needs. This varies on the person’s gender and the causes for the excessive hair growth. Basically the process is not costly,” she mused. Apart from warding off rumours about link-ups, there is another allegation that Hollywood and Bollywood actresses often find themselves dealing with: claims of them going ‘under the knife.’ Before and after plastic surgery pictures of Hollywood starlets like Scarlett Johansson, Halle Berry, Angelina Jolie, Jennifer Lopez, Liv Tyler, Catherine Zeta Jones and Sarah Jessica Parker have been splattered across websites across the world. ‘Bombay Velvet’ star Anushka Sharma is the latest Bollywood starlet who made such headlines when she sported a ‘puffy upper lip.’ Priyanka Chopra’s alleged nose job is evident if you compare her pictures from many years ago. Former Miss Universe Sushmita Sen is apparently the first Bollywood actress to go under the knife when she underwent breast-enhancement surgery and got silicone implants. Cute and bubbly Preity Zinta has been accused of getting a cosmetic face lift when she took on Karan Johar’s ‘Kabhi Alvida Na Kehna’ in 2006. Shilpa Shetty went on an amazing ‘transformation’ while she was shooting for ‘Dhadkan’. Dubbed some years ago as the ‘Most beautiful woman on earth’ Aishwarya Rai has supposedly undergone Rhinoplasty, lip augmentation and cheek implant. Matter of preservation Taking a beautician’s point of view renowned beauty expert Nayana Karunaratne said, “Beauticians address the epidermal layer of the skin. Creams help to maintain the youthful glow up to a certain extent but most of the aging issues are in the dermal layer, the skin tissues stretch as you age.” She notes that a lot of clients visit salons to maintain their good looks. “It is more of a matter of preservation. You need to maintain yourself well to look good. 70 percent of our good looks come from possessing a good skin. You need to lead a healthy lifestyle to achieve this. The nerves which run through your skin need to be soothed for them to function well. Therefore aspects like a healthy diet, mental relaxation and adequate sleep are of vital importance. You can be 50 but still look 40. Many people have aged gracefully because they follow this mantra,” she opined. She notes that there is a great degree of awareness towards cosmetic surgeries than there was some years ago. You witness people who looking younger and better but cannot exactly put your finger on where the difference lies because they keep mum about the botox treatment or the liposuction Maintaining the look “Those days we had no solution for scars except to ask them to camouflage it with cream. Today they can get rid of these nagging problems by cosmetic surgery. However cosmetic surgery should be done with a purpose. If you have a tummy tuck and continue your lifestyle with the same eating habits, you are most likely to put on again. Cosmetic surgeons too do not recommend continuously putting your body under the knife in such short spans. I would advice people to only go ahead if they have the consent of a professional medical doctor,” she stressed adding that though beauticians and cosmetic surgeons can aid an individual to improve their looks it is in their hands to look after themselves and maintain their looks. It is absolutely amazing to see the pains people take to look ethereal today. After all, everyone has a right to look good! ',No
'Flight MH370 ‘crashed in south Indian Ocean’ - Malaysian PM','The missing Malaysia Airlines Boeing 777 was found to have ended its flight in the remote waters of the southern Indian Ocean, the Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak said on Monday, with all 239 people on board feared to have lost their lives in one of the biggest and most baffling tragedies in modern aviation history. More than 17 days after Flight 370 disappeared from radars an hour after taking off from Kuala Lumpur bound for Beijing, Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak announced on Monday night that the flight’s “last position was in the middle of the Indian Ocean”, believed to be more than 2,000 km west of Perth in one of the most remote locations on Earth. Najib said the United Kingdom’s Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB), citing data from satellite company Inmarsat, had established the last position of the missing flight using analysis “never before used in an investigation of this sort”. “This is a remote location far from any possible landing sites,” Mr. Najib said. Questions will now turn to why the Beijing-bound aircraft tragically veered so far off course, plotting a course deep into the Indian Ocean until it likely ran out of fuel and plunged into remote waters. Malaysian officials had said earlier they suspected “deliberate action”, rather than a mechanical failure, after transponders had been turned off sometime around when the pilot last communicated with air traffic control. On Monday, fresh sightings of debris - so far only seen in satellite images - were reported by aircraft scouring the remote waters. China said its Ilyushin-76 planes had spotted two big floating objects and smaller white objects spread over several kilometers, while Australian aircraft also reported spotting debris possibly linked to the aircraft. Australia said a navy ship would likely reach the location of two objects spotted by its military aircraft, on Tuesday morning, allowing them to confirm whether the debris was linked to Flight 370. - THE HINDU ',No

'ESSENCE - (31-03-2014)','7 things that destroy your dog\'s spirit No and stop it! Get off and sit down! Shut up and stop barking! If that\'s all you heard day and day out, just how low would your spirits sink? We know beyond a reasonable doubt that dogs feel sorrow, they get depressed, and the very essence of who they are as a species is threatened by a very common predator: Mankind. Here are seven things that are guaranteed to destroy the spirit of your dog. Best advice ever: Do none of these, but read on to see how many you hear about, read about, or engage in daily. Scold/Yell/Rubbing a Dog\'s Nose in Waste for Relieving Himself in the House: Dogs know we are mad at them when we yell for their \"peeing or pooping\" in the house is a myth. Finding a puddle of piddle in the house may not be pleasant for humans, but dogs do not feel guilt when humans disapprove. Instead, they are reacting to the emotional response of their owner, regardless of when the accident occurred. Screaming or yelling reinforces bullying and because it is happening long after the accident, the dog is left confused and afraid of you. Never ever \"rub a dog\'s nose\" in poo or pee, as this is disgusting, an old school mentality, and just plain mean. Hitting a Dog: Long gone are the days of dominance and animal submission and this is a very outdated belief and training method. All hitting does is teach the dog is that you are to be feared. If you need something to hit, take up a punching bag at the gym or seek anger management. Do not, however, bring a dog into your life. He or she does not deserve this treatment. Punish a Dog in a \"Kennel\" Time Out: If a puppy is not cooperating or not doing the desired behavior during training, it isn\'t that he is being \"spiteful\" or defiant: He is just being a puppy and your behavior needs to be modified. Consider the task at hand and reconsider how you are training. Also, it could be the puppy isn\'t ready for that task or is distracted. The same holds true for adult dogs. If an adult dog does something you are not pleased about, never \"punish\" or \"banish\" them to a kennel. Take Your Dog\'s Food or Treats Away While Eating: Not only is this ridiculous, but it serves nothing more than to assert what a grand bully you are. Though there is something to be said for having a pack leader, dogs should be left alone when eating. If a dog is kind, accepting of strangers, and loving when not eating, then let good enough alone. Many people view a dog who growls when eating as being greedy, but this is just a dog being a dog. Some dogs will bite out of fear or confusion, so let dogs be dogs and let them eat in peace. Don\'t Walk Your Dog or Engage in Quality Time: If you want something that lives yet requires no attention other than to give it water and occasional sunlight, get a houseplant and not a pet. Dogs thrive on companionship, and without mental and physical stimulation, they slowly wither away. Have you ever seen a dog in a shelter who gets little to no interaction and how sad and destroyed his spirit becomes? Do not let this happen to your dog. We are all busy, but our pets rely on us. Walk away from the electronic devices and walk with your dog instead. No matter a dog\'s age, they need interaction with you. Let the Dog Alone for Inordinate Amounts of Time: Again, this is time for a houseplant and not a pet. Dogs need companionship: Not just for the emotional connection and to truly thrive but for their physical well being, too. Would you like to hold your pee in for 10 to 12 hours a day? In fact, some dogs will do so as not to upset their owner. Other dogs will pee inside and then the owner gets made upon return. Seek the services of a family member, friend, neighbor, pet sitter, or doggy day care if you must leave the dog for long hours at a time. Nothing destroys a dog\'s spirit like emptiness, so don\'t do it. Allowing a Dog to Suffer: If an animal is hurt or injured, please seek veterinary care. Allowing an animal to suffer in pain (and dogs are known to hide their symptoms) serves no one. Yes, veterinary care can be expensive, and yes, sometimes we as pet parents don\'t want to hear our dogs are aging and showing signs of it. We owe it to our dogs to give back the unconditional love and dedication they provide to us. Though these are not pleasant reminders to read, they are all too true. If a dog you know is being harmed, speak up, do something, and/or tell someone. A dog\'s life just might depend on it. Pet360.com Jem\'s going to be a live action movie After directing G.I. Joe: Retaliation, Jon Chu is taking on another \'80s favorite: Jem and the Holograms. The fictional animated band is going to come to life in a live action movie from Hasbro Studios helmed by Chu and produced by Bieber\'s manager Scooter Braun, Chu and Jason Blum (who himself has produced everything from Paranormal Activity to The Reader). The trio made the announcement with a YouTube video calling out for fan participation. Jem was a TV series that ran for three seasons in the mid-80s, telling the story of record company and foster home owner named Jerrica Benton who had a secret alter-ego named Jem. Jerrica worked hard to keep the two identities separate, as she only became Jem with the help of Synergy, her holographic computer that could turn her into the glamorous lead singer of the rock band Jem and the Holograms. According to Variety, Ryan Landels has written the script, which will update Jem for the social media era. The producers are envisioning a Jem who, as a teenaged oprhan, becomes Internet famous as a singer and parlays that fame into \"a music-driven scavenger hunt\" that will help her discover a final message left by her father. Production is supposed to begin this spring. Here\'s hoping the new Jem\'s music is just as contagious. CNN L\'Wren Scott leaves fortune to Mick Jagger L\'Wren Scott\'s final wishes have been released and she\'s leaving everything to her partner of 13 years, Mick Jagger. Scott\'s will was signed on May 23, 2013, nearly one year before her tragic death on March 17, and bequeathed all of her \"jewelry, clothing, household furniture and furnishings, personal automobiles and other tangible articles of a personal nature\" and the remainder of her estate to the Rolling Stones frontman, valued at approximately $9 million. According to the document, obtained by \"The Insider With Yahoo,\" her family received nothing. The late fashion designer\'s final testament stirs up a series of questions about why she decided to take her own life at the tender age of 47. While initial reports suggested that the former model was bordering on bankruptcy and her design house, LS Fashion Ltd., was $5.9 million in the red, her assets, including an $8 million New York City apartment and nearly $1 million in valuables, suggest otherwise. Papers were filed on Wednesday at Manhattan\'s Surrogate Court. Following her death, rumors also swirled about the state of her relationship with the famous rocker. However a source told Yahoo, \"They always seemed as fine as you can be.\" Scott\'s relationship with her family appears to be more complicated. The designer, who was adopted as a baby and raised in Ogden, Utah, as Luann Bambrough, did not leave any of her belongings to her adopted siblings, brother, Randall Bambrough, or sister, Jan Shane. Despite being left out of the will, her family members did receive some of her ashes, which they plan to bury in Utah. \"She was cremated and I have some of her ashes,\" Randall Bambrough told the New York Daily News. \"Some of those ashes, they will be buried near our parents here in Utah. And there will be a ceremony, date to be determined, in Utah for all family members who will have an opportunity to see their friends and others.\" Scott\'s funeral took place in Los Angeles on Tuesday. A small and private ceremony was arranged by Jagger, 70, and attended by her family. Yahoo Samsung Galaxy S5 Copper Gold Variant to see Limited Release Worldwide? As more retailers and carriers reveal their plans for the Samsung Galaxy S5, it appears most markets will get only the black and white color options for the device. When the Galaxy S5 was unveiled on Feb. 24 at World Mobile Congress, Samsung announced that it would be available in four colors: Shimmer White, and Charcoal Black, Electric Blue and Copper Gold. Though pre-order, pricing and availability information is now available for carriers and retailers in the US, Canada and parts of Europe, thus far no seller is offering the Samsung Galaxy S5 in all four colors. Last week, UK carrier Vodafone announced that it would be selling the gold Galaxy S5 exclusively, which many sources interpreted as an exclusive for the country. But as more carriers around the world share their model details, it seems more likely that Vodafone may be the only carrier to sell the gold Galaxy S5, period. According to Vodafone, the gold Galaxy S5 will be an \"exclusive from launch.\" Meanwhile, four major US carriers, AT&T, Sprint, T-Mobile and U.S. Cellular, have all begun accepting pre-orders for the Galaxy S5, and all the carriers are offering only the black and white Galaxy S5 options. Samsung Canada has also announced the Galaxy S5 will be available at 11 carriers, which will offer only the black and white options. Samsung has not to responded to IBTimes queries on whether the gold Galaxy S5 will be available to carriers and retailers other than Vodafone. When the Galaxy S5 was unveiled, Samsung introduced the four color options all at once, and many were under the impression they would be widely available, but it appears the manufacturer could end up following a launch schedule similar to what consumers have come to expect. Usually, Samsung launches its devices in white and black, and other color options, such as red, blue, pink, brown, and purple, become available weeks or months later. Certain carriers often get exclusive marketing of certain colors. We saw the launch of the Samsung Galaxy S4 pan out similarly: The device initially was released in White Frost and Black Mist, and over time in several other colors. The Red Aurora Galaxy S4, for example, is sold exclusively by AT&T, while the Blue Arctic was first offered by the Japanese carrier NTT Docomo and was eventually offered by Best Buy for the AT&T, Sprint and Verizon networks. As competitors up the ante, Samsung has followed suit with more daring colors. Apple notably introduced its gold iPhone 5s in September to such a demand that the color was back-ordered for several months. Soon after, Samsung launched the Rose Gold Galaxy Note 3, and now the manufacturer will launch the Copper Gold Galaxy S5. Other rivals have also taken a cue from Apple; the recent unveiled and released HTC One (M8) will also have an Amber Gold color option in addition to Gunmetal Gray and Glacial Silver. There is also no information on which networks will carry the Electric Blue Galaxy S5 at the moment; all that is known is none of the carriers that have announced availability information have details plans to offer the Galaxy S5 in blue. We noted on Samsung\'s U.S. webpage for the Galaxy S5, under design, all four color options are shown, but only the white, black and blue can be viewed in detail. While unconfirmed, we wonder if this could be an indication that Samsung may market the white, black and blue Galaxy S5 options in the US. Samsung opted for a \"modern glam\" look on the Galaxy S5 with a perforated back panel, which is intended to introduce texture into the handling of the new flagship. Prior to its release, there were many rumors that the Samsung Galaxy S5 might come out with a metal design. But Samsung has opted to continue its tradition of outfitting its flagships in polycarbonate. In addition to the updated design and new color variants, Samsung has also outfitted the Galaxy S5 with an Ingress Protection Rating of IP67. Yahoo Woman has Phantom Pregnancy, with Quintuplets A Canadian woman managed to convince her boyfriend and her town that she was pregnant with quintuplets for 34 weeks. It was only when Barbara Bienvenue, 37, went to the hospital to deliver the babies this month that doctors pulled her boyfriend aside to tell him she wasn\'t pregnant and never had been, according to CTV, a Canadian news station. \"I lost everything, it was my whole life,\" her boyfriend Paul Servat told the Toronto Sun, adding that Bienvenue told him she was expecting twins, then triplets, then quadruplets, then quintuplets. He said her belly grew, and she experienced morning sickness and lactation. Marie-Pier Gagnon, a reporter for Le Canada Français, a local French-language newspaper that covers Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu, Quebec, reported on Jan. 23 that the couple was expecting quadruplets. They would be named Alexander, Sebastian, Charles and Rosalie, and they would be born via Cesarean section on Feb. 22 at the CHU Sainte-Justine Hospital in Montreal. Photos of a colorful room with wall-to-wall cribs accompanied the article. Gagnon wrote that the news spurred a movement on social networks to help the couple, and donations poured in. Then, on March 20, Gagnon published another article, revealing that Bienvenue was never pregnant. Local police spokesman Sgt. Luc Tougas said his department is aware of the Bienvenue story, but it has not received any formal fraud complaints from the people who donated money and baby things to the couple. \"The spouse, who was also jilted with this whole story, has been reimbursing some of the associations,\" Tougas told ABCNews.com. \"He was also very stunned. Right now, this woman is at the hospital undergoing psychiatric treatment. We suspect some mental issues.\" A Facebook page soliciting donations for the babies has since been taken down. ABC News sent an email to the account set up to handle donations, but there was no response. Bienvenue experienced a phantom pregnancy, or pseudocyesis, and she is receiving psychiatric care, The Sun reported. Pseudocyesis is a very rare disorder in which a woman experiences all the symptoms of pregnancy, but is not pregnant. Yahoo ',No

'[Citizens’ Mail] 29.05.2014','Indo-Sri Lanka ties: past as good as present President Mahinda Rajapaksa attended the swearing-in ceremony of the new Prime Minister of India Narendra Modi, after being one of the first world leaders to telephone and congratulate him on his Party\'s landslide victory, earlier this month. All of us clearly saw the President\'s magnanimous nature, when he extended an invitation to the Chief Minister of the Northern Provincial Council C.V. Wigneswaran to join him in meeting the new Indian Prime Minister but the latter very irresponsibly, turned it down. This course of action appears to show that Chief Minister Wigneswaran, although with close Sinhala relations, to please certain Tamil sectors and of course Tamil Nadu Chief Minister Jayalalitha included, had chosen a racist path. Instead, Wigneswaran in the greater interest of the Tamil people should have accepted President Rajapaksa\'s invitation, cemented bonds and discussed problems affecting the Tamils in the North as claimed by the TNA, and could have obtained solutions for same from the open-hearted President Rajapaksa. Just before the Indian Prime Minister designate Narendra Modi took oaths, President Rajapaksa as a gesture of goodwill ordered the release of all Indian fishermen in Sri Lankan custody. This move compelled Narendra Modi to publicly declare that he was welcoming the fishing brothers back to India. According to what we saw and read in the media, following the swearing-in ceremony, the two leaders had had discussions, which centred among other matters on the on-going reconciliation process in Sri Lanka. This underlines the concern the President has for the Tamils in the North. The fact that the Indian government has accepted President Rajapaksa as a highly respected statesman and leader is quite clear by the statement made earlier by Senior BJP Leader Dr. Subramaniam Swamy during an IBN live programme. He made it clear that with regard to the Tamil community in Sri Lanka, India has to deal with the elected President and that state governments such as Tamil Nadu have no say whatsoever, when it comes to foreign relations. All these come at a time when President Rajapaksa just completed 44 years in politics, having been elected to Parliament in 1970 as the youngest MP at the age of 24 years. Being the fifth Executive President of Sri Lanka his name is etched in the annals of our history as the national leader who ended the nearly 30 year separatist war and unified the country. That is exactly why his re-election to a second term was endorsed by the people. Sri Lanka and India have had close relations for centuries. The Gautama Buddha who was born in India, according to traditional legends made three visits to Sri Lanka, the first being to Mahiyangana. His second visit was to Nagadeepa and the third to Kelaniya. According to the legends these visits were made because the Buddha foresaw the decline of his teachings in India flourishing in the resplendent island of Sri Lanka. According to the Mahawansa, the great chronicle, the legendary founding father of the Sinhalese, Prince Vijaya arrived in the island with his retinue in the fifth century BC. This had happened coincidentally on the day of the passing away of the Buddha. The Mahawansa is considered the most important literary work of Sri Lankan origin written in Pali around the fifth century AD by Mahanama Maha Thera. Emperor Asoka the greatest ruler of India who converted to Buddhism following the destruction of the thousands of human lives in the Kalinga war, sent his own son the Ven. Mahinda Thera who was to convert King Devanampiyatissa and all of his followers and subjects as well. Traces of Brahmanism and Jainism which originated in India have also been found in pre-Buddhist Sri Lanka and these religions were likely brought over by the early settlers from India. Shortly after the royal family converted to Buddhism, King Devanampiyatissa donated the Mahamega Royal Park in the capital of Anuradhapura to Ven. Mahinda Thera and his companions to use as their residence. The park later became the Mahavihare or great monastery, the centre and stronghold of Theravada Buddhism in Sri Lanka. When many women including Queen Anula wanted to join the Sangha, Emissaries were despatched to Asoka in India to help make this possible and Sangamitta, the sister of Ven. Mahinda was sent to start the Order of Nuns which exists even today. Sangamitta Theri brought with her a branch of the sacred Bodhi Tree from India. This was the very tree that gave shelter to the Buddha when he attained Enlightenment. The branch was planted in 288 AD in Sri Maha Bodhi or the Mahabodhi Temple in Anuradhapura which is today, one of the most sacred and popular Buddhist sites in Sri Lanka. It is on record that when the original Bodhi Tree in India was destroyed, a sapling was taken from the tree in Anuradhapura and replanted in the same spot there. The legends also mention that the alms bowl, collar-bone and other relics of the Buddha were brought over from India and were subsequently enshrined in various stupas in the island. Buddhism flourishes in Sri Lanka today because of India and the links between India and Sri Lanka will not be separated but with the new strong ties between President Mahinda Rajapaksa and Prime Minister Narendra Modi, will no doubt grow to be stronger. HARSHI NADIE PERERA\r\n PILIYANDALA Our people’s response to road accidents is quite good Reckless driving, speeding, driving after liquor consumption, broken roads are some causes for the increase number of road accidents in our country. On the part of the public, jay walking, crossing roads irresponsibly and the like, contribute to road accidents which even could be fatal. We have a high literacy rate in Asia and it is commendable that Sri Lankans wherever they are, co-operate to assist victims at times of accidents. Being intimated of an accident, they converge to the scene and assist in the dispatch of victims to hospitals, even forcibly stopping vehicles passing on the road. There is no case ever reported where an accident victim had been ignored, refused to be taken notice of or being intentionally disregarded by passers-by on our roads. This is what is expected from a cultured society and Sri Lankans certainly live up to that reputation. One shortcoming however, is the non-availability of vehicles at times to rush the victims to hospitals in the event there are no vehicles passing-by. Instances of vehicle owners opening their gates and starting garaged vehicles and bringing them to the scene are very rare, although such occurrences do take place at times. In certain countries, ambulances could be summoned to a scene of an accident in minutes. This facility is not available in our country, as most of the time certain hospitals do not have ambulances. This shortcoming if addressed could make a definite difference. S.R. BALACHANDRAN\r\n WELLAWATTE ',No

'It’s time to assuage road rage','We could all use some friendly reminders on driving etiquette from time to time. It is a set of manners that genuinely meet at the intersection of safety and civility. Being a lady or gentleman behind the wheel not only makes driving less dangerous for everyone, it also makes what can be a laborious task at least a little more congenial. As a general rule we Sri Lankans are a laid-back, polite and well mannered bunch. But all that changes dramatically when we slip behind the wheel of our vehicle. What is it that transforms the easy-going, tolerant character of ours into raging road monsters the moment we back out of our driveway and hit the road? Once inside a vehicle car, customary manners may fly out of the window. Why? For one thing, it could conceivably be because, with all that metal in which you are encased, you feel more invincible. And another is obviously for the reason that other road users are simply so erratically annoying. Safety   Traffic signals   The rush-hour gridlock along our narrow roads in our capital naturally adds to the frustration of the motoring and commuting public. Yes, life in Colombo and suburbia has become a frenzied rat-race with thousands of impatient commuters attempting to beat the clock. Most people driving in rush hour traffic are oblivious to those around them until someone does something to catch their attention. More likely than not it is when they are cut off in traffic or honked at by an intolerant driver. The stories of drivers who take exception to these situations have been labelled as exhibiting road rage. Road rage is a common term used frequently and sometimes inaccurately by those more sensitive to the driving nuances of others. So just how should a person behave during rush hour? When stuck in a stifling car on a scorching hot day in traffic where every other driver is sitting on the horn of their car, it is difficult to concentrate on any of those recommendations. Even the most laid-back driver can have a horrendously bad day.  Don\'t use a mobile phone while driving    A road accident  But remember that driving commands our complete attention and we can\'t do it effectively when we are distracted. Make it a point to focus on one task at a time. When you are driving, just drive! Put your make up on at home. Don\'t try knotting your neck tie at a red light. Avoid munching your breakfast or sipping your morning coffee at the wheel. Never ever use your mobile phone while driving, unless you have a hands-free device. And it is especially important to avoid texting. Here are a few guidelines that should be given to every road user. Always leave on time. If you are rushed and racing to get to an appointment or a meeting, you will be more stressed out and far more likely to ignore proper driver etiquette which could cause some serious problems. Allow people in distress to pull up in front of you when they emerge from \'no-man\'s land.\'It really will not delay your journey if you let one or two cars get into the line ahead of you and you will save yourself and someone else a lot of frustration. Slow down. Going too fast means you could miss a sign or signal and end up in an accident. Remember this is not just about etiquette, it is also about safety. Taboo and dangerous Always give advance notice. If you are going to turn, be sure to turn on your signal ahead of time, not just as you are about to make the turn. This lets the vehicles around you react appropriately. Dim your headlights while driving at night. When coming up on another car, keep in mind that your bright full beam can blind the other driver, whether reflecting in his rear-view mirror or shining directly into the oncoming car. Move to one side when emergency vehicles such as ambulances or fire engines come through. It might be tempting to race ahead, particularly if your turnoff is coming up, but keep in mind as to why they are in a hurry and pull over. Never expect people to guess what you are thinking. It is important to always let them know with signals what you are about to do. Expecting someone to get out of your way because you are in a hurry is only going to cause further problems. Tailgating is taboo and dangerous. There is nothing more annoying than someone who just won\'t back off, so move back and keep an appropriate distance between cars. Following too closely means you probably won\'t have enough time and space to avoid slamming into the rear end of the vehicle ahead of you in the event he brakes suddenly. And if that happens, it will be your own darn fault. Always grant pedestrians every courtesy due to them while they are crossing in front of vehicles or at intersections. By law, as well as by the rules of courtesy, pedestrians have the right to expect the driver to permit them to reach the pavement safely. During wet or slushy weather, the courteous driver will take precautions to avoid \'splashing\' the pedestrians. Being polite It is rude to cause a hold up by driving too slowly. And if you are in a traffic jam please lay off your horn. If you are behind a person at a red stop light and they do not move after a few seconds of the light turning green then a light tap on the horn is not only acceptable but expected. What really fires people up is when they are stuck in a large traffic jam and there is some idiot blaring his car horn endlessly. What exactly are you going to accomplish? Do you think that the people in front of you just forgot that they were supposed to accelerate and that is why traffic is stopped? In the case of a traffic jam the only thing you are accomplishing by blaring your horn is to make certain toughies search for the sharpest object in their vehicle and head your way. And then you might as well abandon your vehicle and run like the blazes, you chump! Being polite on the road is just as important as having good table or parlour manners. How you act will affect the people around you and driving etiquette will also affect how you go through your day. Being nice to people is proven to make you feel better and boost morale. So it`s a good way to start the day off right, by letting someone move into the line ahead of you during rush hour. The professional driver knows that situations often arise as to who has the right-of-way. If drivers or pedestrians jump the gun in these situations, an accident is bound to happen. That is why courtesy, the way-of-right rather than the right-of-way, is so important. gdgasross@gmail.com ',No
'[APPRECIATION - (03-06-2014)]','Sir Baron Jayatilake: A unique statesman Sir Baron Jayatilake, a versatile personality scholar of both oriental and accidental learning, Buddhist educationist, patriot cum exemplary statesman passed away on May 29, 1944 and this year marks his 70th year of demise. Kelaniya is synonymous with the respectable Jayatilake families of Kelaniya - a historic city hallowed by the sacred visit of the Lord Buddha in years of yore. Don Baron Jayatilake was born on February 13, 1868 at Waragoda, Kelaniya in the vicinity of the holy Kelaniya dagoba, Bo-tree and temple. The spiritual fragrance and the Dhamma profoundly influenced and moulded his exemplary character in years to come. His father a devale Dayakaya, of that temple was Don Daniel Jayatilake, an employee of the Ceylon Government Railway and his place of origin was Pattalagedera, Veyangoda. He settled down in that village after getting married to a lady of the Weerasinghe family in Waragoda. When their son Don Baron was just five years, he was first inducted to Sinhala letters in the alphabet by an erudite oriental scholar Buddhist monk Ven. Ratmalane Sri Dharmaloka, the founder Rector of the Vidyalankara Pirivena, in Peliyagoda, Kelaniya. For his elementary learning of the English language, he was admitted to the Baptist Missionary school and later for his secondary education, he was sent to Wesley College, Colombo, then located in the Pettah. This teenaged student was entrusted to the Vidyalankara Pirivena to drink deep in the Dhamma, Sinhala Buddhist culture, Sinhala, Pali, Sanskrit, Elu and Prakrit. So much so, his mastery of them paved the way for him to emerge as a renowned oriental scholar and a reputed classical Sinhala author. At Wesley, he creditably got through the Cambridge (Local) Junior and Senior examinations. At the college prize-giving, he easily won almost all the prizes. Not born with a silver spoon in his mouth, he applied for a clerical post in the Lands Department, but fate decreed otherwise. The interview board headed by a British Civil Servant advised him to take to teaching so he accepted the post of Principal of the Kandy Academy in 1890, the precursor of Dharmaraja College. It was at that time managed by the Buddhist Theosophical Society. He was the head of that new Buddhist College in Kandy till 1898. By then he obtained the Bachelor of Arts degree of the Indian University of Calcutta. English and Latin being two of his subjects. Thereafter, he was appointed the Vice Principal of Ananda College. After one year, he was promoted as the Principal of that collegiate school. It was the leading Buddhist English College in our country. D.B. Jayatilake, Ananda College Principal simultaneously, held the post of Manager of the BTS. In addition the YMBA was his brainchild. Elected the first President of that august association, he held that responsible, prestigious post continuously till 1944. On August 12, 1898 he married Mallika, the daughter of Pandit Batuwantudawa of Kalutara, Warahena. At the age of 42, Jayatilake, who had a thirst for higher academic and professional studies, relinquished his post of Principal. In June 1910 he set sail to join the internationally recognized British University of Oxford. Entering Jesus College, affiliated to that university, he graduated BA (Oxon.) in 1913. Not resting on his laurels he read for the Barristers examinations at Lincoln\'s Inn - one of the four Law Colleges in London, the other three being Grays Inn, Inner Temple and Middle Temple. Jayatilake was called to the Bar in 1913. When in England, he espoused the cause of Buddhism by delivering resourceful lectures at seminars and societies. Despite his strenuous studies in Arts and Law, he never hesitated to visit the London Museum and Victoria Museum to peruse existing, literary works in Sinhala and Pali. As a result of his research on such intellectual pursuits, he was able to re-edit some classical Sinhala literature text books. On his return to the land of his birth he was duly admitted and enrolled as an Advocate of the Supreme Court. But he was not able to establish himself as a legal practitioner. True to the common adage \'many are selected but few are chosen in the profession of law\', D B Jayatilake abandoned that profession and took to public service. In order to ameliorate the social conditions of the Sinhala Buddhists he got involved in the Temperance Movement founded in Mirigama, headed by Mudaliyar Don Spater Senanayake of Botale Walawwa. That movement was ably assisted by his three sons DC, FR and DS Senanayake, the first Prime Minister of Independent Sri Lanka. When the Sinhalese-Muslim riots broke out in May 1915, the colonial British Governor acted ruthlessly to pacify slight religious disharmony between the two hitherto amicable races. The Governor at that time was Sir Robert Chalmers. Without rhyme or reason, he entrusted the Police and Army irresponsible task of suppressing the Sinhala Buddhists. The Inspector General of Police H.L. Dowbiggins, Army Chief Malcolm and the GA Western Province Fraser acted stupidly in discharging duties allocated to them. They first arrested Buddhist leaders of the calibre of D.B. Jayatilake, the three Senanayake brothers, Edmund Hewavitharana, W.A. de Silva, Charles Batuwantudawa, Dr. C.A. Hewavitarana, Arthur V. Dias, Piyadasa Sirisena and several others. D. Edward Henry Pedris who hailed from Dangedara, Galle was court martialled summarily and after a perfunctory trial was sentenced to death by shooting. He was executed on July 7 within the precincts of the Welikada prison. At Biyagama, the military and the G.A. Fraser took into custody D. Francis Alahakoon known as Punchi Gurunnanse, a Sinhalese school master of repute in the Biyagama, Kaduwela area along with his two sons-in-law D Jompi Amarakoon, Village Headman, Biyagama and Peter de Saram of the Biyagama Walawwa. They all tried to prevent non-violence in the Muslim village of Malwana. They too were convicted at the court martial held in Dompe. They were sentenced to death by hanging on the perjury of a few well to be Muslims of Malwana. Punchi Gurunnanse\'s other son-in-law Dalugama Mudiyanselage Don Girigoris Gunawardena Ralahamy - Village Headman Waduwegama, Biyagama, was taken into custody and after detention at the Welikada prison for a short period was later released on representations made on his behalf to the Governor by Advocate E.W. Perera and the new Advocate D.B. Jayatilake. After their release in August that year, when the great patriot E.W. Perera, proceeded to England to present a petition to the British Parliament against the Governor\'s excesses during the period of martial law - the colonial administration of terror, D.B. Jayatilake too set sail to that country and explained the inhuman atrocities perpetrated on innocent Sinhalese Buddhists due to the haughty indifference of Governor Sir Robert Chalmers. As a result of the representations made by the lawyer, duo the errant Governor was recalled and Sir John Anderson was appointed the new Governor. After his return, he was elected the President of the Ceylon National Congress in 1923, a forceful association to press for self-government by a gradual process. D.B. Jayatilake emerged as a politician not by choice but by an irony of fate or destiny. In October 1924, he was elected uncontested as the member of the Colombo District in the Legislative Council and Vice President of the Council in 1930. Under the Dononghmore Constitution the State Council was established and universal suffrage was bestowed on each and every citizen over 21. This universal franchise was made use of in both the State Council elections in 1931 and 1936. Ours was the first country in Asia to gain that privilege. At the elections in 1931 and 1936, D.B. Jayatilake was returned uncontested as the State Councilor to represent the newly carved out electorate of Kelaniya. On both those occasions he was appointed the Minister of Home Affairs and Leader of the House. Whilst being a Member of the State Council and holding the responsible portfolio of Home Affairs, he commenced compiling the Sinhala dictionary for which he got the services of Julius D. de Lanerolle of Bomiriya. They were assisted by the German oriental scholar William Geiger who arrived in Sri Lanka for research on the Sinhala language, the history of the Sinhalese community and their culture. DB was elected President of the Royal Asiatic Society, Ceylon Branch. The publication \'The Buddhist\' was edited by him. It is to the credit of his profound mastery of both the Sinhala and Pali languages, that he edited a number of classical text books on Buddhism. That scholar statesman advocated the establishment of a residential university in Peradeniya. Jayatilake Hall stands as a monument to his memory. Furtherance to honour him D.B. Jayatilake was conferred with the honorary degree - Honris Causa of LLD (on the opening ceremony of the University of Ceylon). On that historical occasion Prof. E.F.C. Ludowyke paid tribute to his great achievements in arts, Law and oriental learning. That great leader was fortunate enough in 1943 to obtain for the Kelaniya Vidyalankara Pirivena the Buddha relics from India. Those relics were discovered by the renowned British archeologist Cunningham. The crowning of the pinnacles on the top of the Ruwanweliseya, the huge dagoba in Anuradhapura was performed by that great Buddhist leader on June 17, 1940. In recognition of his yeoman services to the country and his loyalty to the British Empire D.B. Jayatilake was Knighted in January, 1943. Sir Baron Jayatilake was appointed the first Ambassador rather Envoy to India in 1943. Shortly afterwards, Sri Baron fell sick and wished to be flown back to Sri Lanka. When the aeroplane carrying him reached Bangalore, he breathed his last on May 29, 1944. Such patriotic leaders are rarely born. STANLEY E. ABEYNAYAKE Alex M. Jayawardena: Dedicated to work for the handicapped It is with profound sadness yet with great admiration that I write about the late Alex M. Jayawardena and his services to the visually blind people of our country. He himself being a visually handicapped person, was registered with the Visually Handicapped Federation as a member in 1969. During his long term of office he served as Treasurer, Vice President and finally became President of the Federation in 2009. His contributions through hard and dedicated work throughout the years, have been very remarkable. In 1982, Alex Jayawardena initiated and was responsible for establishing a Trust Fund for the Rehabilitation of Visually Handicapped people. As a result today many of them who are generally disowned and sidelined from their families, have found a promising future. His dedication to these down-trodden people had no boundaries. In the same year, the technically trained visually handicapped people who served at the Training Institute for the Deaf and Blind, located in Seeduwa, was closed down. As a result the staff there lost their employment and were in a state of disarray. At that time, Jayawardena fought for their rights and was instrumental in getting them compensation payment from the government. He did not stop there but continued to work for the welfare of these people. He lobbied with the government for a monthly allowance for them. As a result of his perusals, an allowance of Rs. 300 was granted to each person, which with time has now increased to Rs 1,500 per month. Due to his untiring efforts, he was able to get these people the pension rights of their parents legally after their demise. Many years ago handicapped people did not have any transparent manner of casting their votes during an election. Due to Jayawardena\'s intervention, today they are able to freely cast their votes to any candidate of their choice, accompanied by someone trust worthy. This followed an Act which was even passed in Parliament in the year 2011. Jayawardena\'s only concern was to work for the rights and welfare of these people and that he safely accomplished. He was the pioneer in setting up a cricket organization for the visually handicapped people in Sri Lanka. In the years 2003, 2006 and 2009 cricket teams of the visually handicapped even participated in international cricket. Jayawardena went to the extent of securing employment in the government sector for the handicapped persons who excelled in studies. It was just one month before his death, that a female blind graduate was registered as a Development Officer at the Matale Provincial Council. There were many obstacles which he had to face but Jayawardena proved to be an achiever. To his credit, there were many other projects which he initiated. It was in 1996 that a group of deserving blind people was recruited with the \'Adopt a Grand Parent Program\' through Helpage Sri Lanka. Through this program, funds were channeled for the welfare of these people. He proved to be an excellent Project Manager. In the winding-up stage of this program when funds were allocated for sustenance, the Handloom Weaving Industry in Demanhandiya/Katana was revived. Jayawardena set up two other training centers for the handicapped and abandoned young girls. He acquired a closed down school on a 2 1/2 acre block of land and set up two training centers in Mahameegaswewa and Walasmulla. Blind men and women were trained in the art of handloom weaving, rattan work, production of rugs, ekel and coir brooms, agriculture, animal husbandry as well as voice training. Although he was a devout Buddhist under his supervision, a choir was formed for carol singing as a fundraiser during Christmas time. The Elders\' Home for the Visually Handicapped in Godawaya is another landmark to his services. He attracted several foreign donors in his effort to upgrade facilities in this Home. Alex M. Jayawardena met with his tragic and untimely death on the March 6, 2014 while travelling after work from office to his home in Seeduwa. Thousands of people who benefited through him will join me in appreciating his services, which was evident by the large numbers of blind people who gathered at his funeral to pay their last respects to their fallen hero. May this wonderful gentleman attain the Bliss of Nibbana! JINADAREE GUNAWARDENA',No

'Traffic policemen assaulted by three wheel driver','Panadura Additional Magistrate Sadun Gamage, ordered cash bail in Rs. 5,000 and personal bail in Rs. 500,000 with two sureties on each of the two suspects produced before Court from remand in connection with assaulting two traffic constables of the Panadura Division Traffic Unit when the case was called before Court on Thursday, May 29. Sub Inspector Palihawadana of Bandaragama Police told court that Traffic Policemen who were on mobile duty along the Bandaragama - Panadura Road on May 24, had received information that three youth in a three wheeler were following a bus transporting school girls who had visited the Panadura Beach. The Traffic Policemen ordered the driver of the three wheeler to stop the vehicle near the Bandaragama Junction, but the driver had not obeyed the order and proceeded. The Traffic Policemen had given chase, while a vehicle load of policemen in a police jeep belonging to the Bandaragama Police had also arrived. The three wheeler had knocked against the Police jeep in a bid to escape. Two men had got off the three wheeler and assaulted the two traffic policemen, injuring them. They had been admitted to the Panadura Base Hospital on March 23. Police had arrested the driver and two others. One suspect had escaped. One suspect had also been injured and admitted to the Panadura Hospital. The police jeep had been damaged extensively due to the accident. The damage had not been estimated so far. A report had been called from the Colombo Division Police Property Development Unit, but the report had not been received. Police moved that the three suspects be remanded further. The Additional Magistrate refused the application and ordered bail on the suspects. Attorney defending suspects say case fabricated Attorney- at- Law Amila Navalage defending the suspects informed Court that the Assistant Superintendent of Police Horana, or other responsible Police officers had not submitted a comprehensive official report of the damage caused to the Police jeep although the vehicle was damaged when the three wheeler driven by a suspect knocked against it. The three suspects had been assaulted by the policemen after they were arrested. One suspect was still warded at the Panadura Base Hospital. This was a fabricated case, he said. The suspects were produced before Court under the Public Property Act. He moved bail for the suspects as there was no official report from the Assistant Superintendent of Police Horana, regarding the damages caused to the Police jeep by the suspects The Additional Magistrate who considered the submissions of both parties, granted bail on the three suspects and postponed the case for June 26.',No

'School vans to be fitted with GPS technology','The Global Positioning System (GPS technology) will be introduced to vehicles transporting schoolchildren to monitor these vehicles, Private Transport Services Minister C.B.Ratnayake said. He said GPS is a satellite navigation system that provides information on the location of school vans. \"We can monitor the conduct of the van crew as well as schoolchildren at whatever location,\" he said. \"We can monitor the time the vans departs and if the van detours, their speeding and any harassment of schoolchildren in the vans,\" Ratnayake said. He said it will also be made mandatory for all school vans to carry a first aid kit to be used in an emergency. Drivers of school vans will be instructed to use on board radio to let children listen to educational programs only, the minister said. Ratnayake said a 14-member committee has been appointed to regulate school transport vehicles due to the fact that a number of vehicle accidents involving school students has been on the rise in the recent past. The committee comprises representatives from the National Transport Commission, Department of Motor Traffic, Traffic Police, Education Ministry, Transport Ministry, Provincial Road and Passenger Transport Authority, National Child Protection Authority and the Attorney General\'s Department, the minister said. He said under the new regulations, all school service vehicles will have to register with the Private Transport Services Ministry and new regulations will be introduced regarding the maximum number of children to be transported in the vehicle and the fee charged for transportation. The first meeting of the newly appointed committee will be held today. The minister said the committee would consider the quality of the school vans, security and protection provided for children, the fees charged from parents, the number of children that can be carried in a van and registering school vans. He added that the ministry is also considering an insurance scheme for school vans to provide a cover for the children. ',No
'A GHOST of a chance?','The truth is out there. Paranormal activity: Real or False? Is there life after death? If there is, then that would justify the idea that ghosts are real. Around the planet debate rages whether it is possible that a person’s spirit can survive death and remain in this world. Are ghosts or poltergeists real? Just because science can’t prove their existence, does it mean that they are a figment of man’s imagination? Will science evolve to a level one day when it will be able to detect and prove paranormal activity? Is a haunting real? Writers throughout the world have used this idea to write bestselling novels. Stephen King’s terrifying novel “The Shining”, talks about a haunted hotel and the fearful experiences that a family of three experiences in this haunted hotel. Are hauntings real? The ‘Daily News’ investigated this area.  Professor K.A.L.A\r\n \t\t\tKuruppuarachchi.\r\n \t\t\tPicture by Gayan Pushpika Ghostly encounter Anusha who has directly experienced a ghostly encounter shared her story with us. “This happened near Ulapane, when I was a six years old. The exact village name is “Weliganga.” The place is near to the last house of this village. Beyond that house is a waste land. This waste land belongs to the Atabage Power House Project. “Unfortunately this house is owned by one of my Uncles. So we used to go there. Those days my parents lived near this house. The day we experienced this activity, we went to the Katunayake Airport to say goodbye to one of my aunties who was going abroad. After that we came to my uncle’s place. “After that around midnight, we started to go back to our place from Uncle’s house. Near my uncle’s place there is big narrowed slope on the road. Many road accidents have happened in this place before this incident I relate. On one side of the road there is a Nuga tree, and on the other side- a small stream with a small waterfall. “When we were passing that place (Me, my father, my mother and my 4 year old sister), suddenly we heard a sound like someone was walking wearing boots. We didn\'t have any source of light other than the moonlight. “But we couldn\'t see anyone. After that we saw a jeep coming towards us from the top of the slope in high speed. The jeep collided with something with a huge sound and the doors of the jeep opened because of the effect of the collision. “The driver and another man (as I remember two of them were middle aged people) got off and looked at the front of the jeep. Amazingly there was no one or any object. They soon got onto the jeep and left. “After that there was a period of silence for a few minutes. Then again we heard that boot sound again. We immediately left the place after that. “A few years after, a cousin brother of mine who lives in the house mentioned above, confirmed that some paranormal activities had taken place in that house and its surroundings. But he never told me what they were.” Extra- terrestrial experiences Speaking to the Daily News Professor K.A.L.A Kuruppuarachchi, Senior Professor of Psychiatry Faculty of Medicine, University of Kelaniya, Ragama, said, “Paranormal happenings is an area which is not scientifically proven. It is beyond the normal human experiences. It is a phenomenon. It includes things like telepathy, telekinesis and ghosts stories. There are phenomena like extra sensory perceptions. Even extra- terrestrial experiences are included in that. All over the world there are people who believe in ghost stories. All over the world in many cultures the belief in ghosts is prevalent.” Current existing science finds it difficult to prove some of the phenomena. In the USA and Australia, work in the paranormal has been funded. But the difficulty is proving some of the events. Do we survive death and if so what is a ghost? What is a poltergeist? These are questions that have been asked for centuries. Popular Hollywood television series like the ‘X Files’ have answered these questions in so many imaginative ways. While the ‘X Files’ may be fiction the questions remains: is it possible for some part of us to survive death and return to this world? How little we know of death and what may come after death. “From ancient times people have been frightened of death and dying, which is why people are interested in the paranormal. Almost every religion discusses these areas in various ways. When you examine the idea of the continuation of the life after death, according to some beliefs our energy is not going to die, whereas the body is the material part which we are going to leave after death. So some people believe that there is a continuity of the consciousness. They believe that when the physical body dies, the consciousness does not die and then there is continuity. And as a result of that people believe in rebirth. It may not be the same person but it may not be a different person also. The energy continues,” Dr. Kuruppuarachchi explained. Psychiatric symptoms We have to be extremely cautious because we must not be misled. Lots of people who believe in ghost stories are perfectly normal. Ghostly experiences can be attributed to normal phenomena or psychiatric symptoms. The belief in the presence of evil, (writing this gives me the chills!) the presence of something malevolent has been with us since childhood. Somehow is it possible for our fear to affect our imagination? Do we perceive some threat or harm from an entity that may only exist in our imagination? “If you take normal people, it may depend on their awareness and belief system. What may happen is due to the dark, when you are alone and frightened, there is a possibility of sensing ghosts. In the darkness when you are alone in the house a shaking branch in the wind may be perceived as a ghost. If you are walking near a cemetery during the night, you may think that there may be a ghost there. Fear may lead us to think there is a ghost and cause us to imagine certain things. What you have learnt from your ancestors and culture also could be a contributing factor. You may experience normal events and misperceive them as ghosts. Sometimes because of grief, eerily, some people believe that the spirit of the deceased person is present – a haunting. This depends on your mental state or your belief system,” he said. All this seems to be interconnected coming under the umbrella of the paranormal. They would seem to support each other and then at the same time they may not have any relevance to each other: ghosts, near death experiences, life after death. “Many in the world believe in rebirth. Research has also been done in relation to near death experiences. When people are facing a life threatening situation or when someone is dying they may experience near death experiences. These are some symptoms of near death experiences. E.g. travelling through a dark tunnel, seeing a bright light, a floating like experience, recalling the past, some people believe they are connected to the universe. In Ragama hospital we have done research work with some Australian consultants. We interviewed the people who had life threatening illnesses and we found 20 percent of the people/ patients in the hospital experienced this phenomenon (near death experiences). Some people were detached from the body, and had these out of body experiences, some people felt a floating experience, meeting with their dead relatives, seeing bright lights, a light at the end of the tunnel and feeling extremely happy. The phenomenon is there but why it is happening is the question. These near- death experiences could be a problem with the blood supply or a chemical imbalance in the brain or is it that there is really life after death? So still we don’t have a proper answer for this. But the near- death experience phenomenon is there. So all these are grey areas which science finds difficult to prove,” he noted. Different identity Under certain psychiatric conditions people may hear voices of unseen people and they see figures – this may be Schizophrenia or some psychotic illnesses. “In Psychiatry there are possession states. These can be seen amongst normal people. If you go to a temple of religious place, you may fall into a trance state and behave as if you are under the influence of a spirit. There is no demon really, but you are in trance state. The thinking pattern and the belief system, influence this trance state. When you are under stress your mental faculty is disassociated. Most of these people are normal people, but some are ill people. This happens when you are under stress or when you believe in these stories. At the Thovil, with the beating of the drums, the mind is disassociated and the subject behaves in a different manner. A different identity comes about as a result of disassociation. When you passionately believe, there is the possibility of this happening. This happens when you are highly emotionally involved and/or distressed,” Prof. Kuruppuarachchi said. ',No
'UN acting with bias on world issues','Press TV has conducted an interview with human rights activist Dr. Randy Short to get his views on the forces behind sectarian violence in different countries around the world.  Transcript of the interview: Press TV: Our guest in London has actually talked about the situation in Syria and used that and basically saying, of course, Tehran’s support for Damascus is part of the problem. I want to talk about that... Do you think what is happening in... for example, you talked about in various Muslim countries, is something accidental or do you think it’s systematic? Short: Well, first I want to respond to the comment made on Iran and Syria. Iran has the right to support its allies and the people who created the problem are the Wahhabis and the Zionists and the Americans and British who want to get rid of Syria because it wouldn’t play ball with the Mediterranean Dialogue, among other things. So, it’s ironic that this man (other guest) would attribute this situation in Syria... Well, no. Your ideas are ridiculous. I didn’t interrupt you. You don’t like hearing facts from another point of view, typical for your Melanin count. But, I want to just say to you that what happens in Syria needed not to happen. It should have never happened if countries had wanted peace there. Now, in terms of there being a systematic attack on societies where Muslims are present, this goes back hundreds of years, but let’s just keep it in the post-war era. \r\nChildren in Gaza  In the post-war era, you can look at some of the issues that happened with the state of India even being created. They set Pakistan up as a failed state. There was no need to break up India. There should have been a way to hold it together. When he talks about these civil wars, these are states created by Europeans for the benefit of Europeans to hurt people who may be Muslim or non-white, who have been commonized or oppressed. So, let’s just be honest. The Muslim countries tend to be in areas that are resource-rich and no one wants to pay the masses of people what they are worth. So, they support their proxy dictators and these want-to-be Muslim Wahhabis, and this is what the problem is in many parts of the world and other places, the British and French had divide-and-rule policies, as well as other countries. To make this short, Muslim on Muslim crime is outrageous. That is like calling what is happening in Ukraine white-on white violence without getting deep into it and I’d expect more from a diplomat. Press TV: I want to look at the situation in the Central African Republic (CAR). As you said, you talked about the situation in India and said that it was in Pakistan, set up to be a failed state. I want to look at the situation in CAR and the supporting of the coup and do you think that this was all set up to end up right where it is today, Dr. Short? Short: Very basic history. The father of what became the Central African Republic was assassinated by the French, because he was too independent and they put in one stooge after the other, and then when they ran out of Catholic stooges from one particular ethnic group, I guess they led this gentleman that came in and that’s when you have the problem with the tensions there. But there are a lot of things going on. You have people that are Tutsis killing people in CAR who have fled from Congo, I’m sorry Hutus that have fled war going on in Africa where the Tutsis are the proxies of the United States and Great Britain, as a means to displace the French. So, you know this is really about who gets to take the other non-white people’s stuff and what kind of proxy-slaves can we put in power to allow this piracy and theft of resources to continue as long as this can be done. In terms of Sri Lanka, the diplomat should know that part of the tension in Sri Lanka was that the Sinhala was put below the Tamil by the British. Wherever the European people have gone, they have made things worse. The Europeans in India, the British, did genocide on the Moguls, they killed hundreds of thousands of Muslim people and created greater tension between Muslims and Hindus than what existed before. So, you can’t change history because you find your conscience pricked because you happen to identify with the people that commit these global crimes.  UN building, New York  The United Nations tends to protect the rights of the lighter skinned, powerful people. It can create a state of Israel and yet can’t address the issue in Syria and can’t stop genocide in Gaza and doesn’t do anything about genocide against Muslims in Africa or for that matter, anywhere else. This is just a fact. It is an outrage that in Myanmar that the Western countries are flooding in to do business with that country as they exterminate people. It’s about people being paid under the table and looking the other way as people get murdered and that sometimes happens to Christians like West Papua with the Indonesians killing folks, but it’s all about money and who is getting the most? The Western countries. ...I’m going to continue to say in India, the reason that you have these things going on in India is that the Caste Hindus, the ones who identify as Aryan or whites, they killed the Dalits, they killed the Muslims, they killed the tribals, they oppressed people, but they are aligned with the British. They are the most anglicized people who buy billions of dollar’s worth of skin lightening cream because they want to be white. White supremacy comes from this colonial period is part of the problem. ...The world hasn’t changed. It is still unjust and in fact, these invasions in Africa, even this president here trying to reignite the Cold War with (Russian President Vladimir) Putin who is showing restraint, shows that some people live in the past and the ones who benefited from how it has been in the past tend to be Europeans, tend to be people on the lighter hue colour of humanity who have benefited from an unfair global system by the way, that does not like Muslims, has killed Muslims, that sends money to Saudi Arabia. In fact, Saudi Arabia gets arms and it inflates these economies that support it by buying weapons from the United States and investing and there is an agreement to oppress their own people and they buy in the West, and in reality, Nasser, someone I happen to respect, observed that the small populated Muslim countries get all the oil money instead of spreading it around where there is a Zakat, where the people can be lifted up. This is what needs to happen with the wealth instead of it being used to kill people in Syria, instead of it being used to bribe governments to not deal with the Palestinian issue or any of the issues whether it’s in Nigeria or somewhere else. So, these wars are still going on because people are fighting to control the destiny of black, Muslim, and brown people. Courtesy: Press TV ',No

'Neymar leads Brazil to opening win','At the stroke of midnight on New Year\'s Eve, Brazilians flock to the beach. Dressed in white, they jump over seven waves to bring good luck and peace for the year to follow. At the Arena de Sao Paulo, heroes in yellow shirts tentatively jumped the first wave in the opening match of the World Cup, but they will need to jump the next six with greater conviction if they are to win their sixth title, on home soil. \"There are seven steps,\" Brazilian coach Luiz Felipe Scolari said on the eve of the match against Croatia. \"We have to go up those seven steps but to start we have to think of the first step. We can\'t jump the seven steps.\" he 3-1 win was unconvincing. It was marred in refereeing controversy. And it was only sealed when Oscar scored against the run of play in stoppage time as Croatia peppered Brazilian keeper Julio Cesar, coming desperately close to scoring an equaliser.  Julio Cesar (L) and Marcelo of Brazil watch as a deflected shot goes in during the 2014 FIFA World Cup Brazil Group A match between Brazil and Croatia at Arena de Sao Paulo on June 12, 2014 in Sao Paulo, Brazil. Elsa Above anything else, the match illuminated what most already know: Brazil\'s reliance on their leading man, Neymar. When Neymar scores, a nation\'s heart explodes. He scored twice in this match: an equaliser in the first half right on dusk after Brazil had inexplicably conceded an early goal, and then a questionable penalty as the chill set in that only just beat Croatian keeper Stipe Pletikosa. \"It was better than I thought,\" Neymar said afterwards. \"I was hoping that we\'d win, but to be able to debut in a World Cup with a brace is an immeasurable joy.\" On both occasions, the goals not only sparked wild celebration in the stadium but fireworks outside of it. They came from the nearby favelas, which houses Brazil\'s poorest families, and it underlined the significance of this World Cup for them as much as any of the national side\'s outrageously paid players. A constellation of footballing superstars has gathered in Brazil, but there are two who many believe have the outcome of it at their feet. One is Argentina\'s Lionel Messi. The other is his Barcelona teammate, the precocious 22-year-old with the spiked mullet straight from a 1980s music video but with unmistakable style everywhere else. Neymar has drawn comparisons to other great Brazilian players in his relative short career.

Buda Mendes Neymar is also a national distraction. With a national holiday declared in Sao Paulo on Thursday, the normally clogged streets of the mega city were eerily calm. The exception, of course, was the violent protests 13km from the stadium earlier in the day, in which police used tear gas to quell the mob and three journalists were left bloodied and broken. Despite this, it became evident as you edged closer to the stadium where most of the 22 million people who inhabit this massive city were: on the street, standing next to their brother or sister or best friend, wearing a yellow shirt, holding a drink in one hand and a horn in the other. Inside, most of the crowd of 62,103 - 3000 less than capacity - was bathed in yellow, with the exception of a pocket of Croatian supporters in red and white. In the 11th minute, those in yellow weren\'t so much silenced but stunned when Marcelo conceded an own goal. Croatia could\'ve scored earlier when a Ivica Olic header went wide. This time, midfielder Nikica Jelavic overran a cross, it clipped his heal and Marcelo barely had time to react as he accidentally slotted the opening goal of the tournament. After attracting a yellow card for an errant elbow to the throat of Croatia\'s Luka Modric, Neymar scored the equaliser but the seminal moment of the match came in the second half.

'How to scotch a rumour with a slap of humour!','From Sri Lanka’s rustic backwoods tea kiosks to Colombo’s elitist social parlours, everyone loves a good rumour. I once informed a group of journalists at the Hong Kong Press Club, that it was rumoured, that Colombo was the gossip capital of the world. No, countered a British colleague contending that the dubious distinction belonged to London. An American veteran copy editor joined the discussion querying whether the British gossiped more than the Americans. “Probably not.” said the Brit, “but we do read more gossipy newspapers than New York City, Los Angeles and Chicago combined.” However contentious the issue about the Mecca of rumour mongering is, it must be admitted that rumours are the oldest form of mass media. After all, with a history dating back to two and a half millennia, we surely must have more practice of spreading the news whether true or false. I still stick to my line of reasoning that my compatriots are second to none among the nosiest nosy parkers in the universe. And we have an unquenchable obsession for adding grist to the rumour mill. Going by the law of averages, already today thousands of Sri Lankans would have probably passed on tens of thousands of some juicy bits of information they have heard, without first rigorously tracking down their source. Rumours can be true or damnable defamation. They can come from your denigrators and can just come from people who are haters or jealous of your success. They can even be conjured up by people who you thought were your friends. Rumour is a powerful medium to use in any situation. But now and again, a tiny scrap of poppycock can spread to devastating proportions and result in fortunes lost, careers ruined and in business it can cause widespread and irreversible damage among your customer base, shareholders and employees. The biggest curse of modern life is the telephone. Indeed, it is the communicator that has helped scatter whispers of discord from ear to flapping ear. Had Alexander Graham Bell lived today quite a few of us would have lynched him with a phone cord. Let me regale you with some true stories about rumours I have faced. The names have been changed or withheld. But it is not to protect the identity of the characters involved, but to protect myself from their wrath. My wife and I had just returned from a long sojourn overseas. The moment we arrived home the phone rang. The caller soon broke the sad news that an elderly former colleague and friend domiciled Down Under had died. Of course we knew the old boy was over the hill but could not for the world of us accept he was now under it. We spent hours contacting his relatives and mutual friends who seemed as ignorant as we were about the sad passing away. Finally, I called up his home to be greeted by his answering machine. So all I said after the message beep was to say: “Chris this is Gaston. We heard some very sad news. Would someone please return our call!” My wife and I finally slept late. Around midnight that infernal contraption of Graham Bell awoke us rudely. My wife answered and turned pale as if she was hearing the voice of a midnight ghost. All she could say in her dumbfounded state was: “Chris, Chris...Chris is that you?” We all had a good laugh after it was revealed that the “news of his death had been greatly exaggerated.” On another occasion I was involved in an accident when the car I was travelling in turned turtle. No one was badly injured although I had sustained a couple of broken ribs and a slight gash on my temple. While a doctor was wrapping a crepe bandage around my torso I asked a friend to call the office and say I would not be in for work that day. I do not know how the message was conveyed. But the rumour spread like wildfire in the office that I was in hospital in a pretty bad condition. When I walked gingerly into the office the following day there was a huge welcoming cheer. Never since the miracle of Lazarus did the spectacle of my appearance inspire such spontaneously thundering applause. Whatever the source of a rumour, it needs to be dealt with in a prudent way. It is true that a mind conscious of innocence laughs at the lies of rumour. I have developed a hands-on mechanism that serves me just fine as far as rumours go. I have learned that if I greet a vicious rumour with humour, it gets snuffed out and dissipates in sudden death.  It begins to sound hollow and unbelievable, even to the person perpetuating it, who then feels ridiculous about spreading a story that is so flimsy as to invite laughs. The right reaction should be incredulity and scepticism , but utter untamed laughter shreds the gossip and leaves the rumour on unsteady ground. It wanes thereafter and eventually gets buried under the weight of its own disbelief. Newspapers offices can sometimes be hotbeds of gossip, intrigue and rampant rivalry. So when a notorious editorial gossip had spread an unforgivable rumour about me I confronted him with a huge laugh. I walked up to him and said: \"Look here Joseph, I really don\'t mind rumours. Because I find out so much about myself that I didn\'t even know. I will offer you a bargain. If you will stop telling lies about us we will stop telling the truth about you!\" I continued: \"It\'s amazing the lies that people will believe about me when the truth is actually far more interesting. And if you promise to behave yourself properly, no questions will be asked about your parentage.\" The large editorial audience snickered and laughed like drains. I then slapped him hard on the cheek. And before he could protest I yelled: \"Mosquito!\" gdgasross@gmail.com ',No

'Lankan sues Malaysia Airlines for $ 250,000','An elderly Sri Lankan woman who set out on an overseas holiday to visit her family in Sri Lanka ended up with a broken leg before she even made it to her home country. On April 4, Vineetha Warnakulasuriya, 72, was travelling with her son, daughter-in-law, and her two grandchildren on a Malaysia Airlines flight from Melbourne Airport when she had a fall on the travelator about an hour before departure. Paramedics assisted her and Warnakulasuriya was cleared to continue her flight, after she made an agreement with the airline to have wheelchair assistance for the entire journey to Colombo. However, according to Shine Lawyers solicitor Joseph Wheeler his client was not given the support she needed for the entirety of her trip. After being wheeled off the plane and onto the next one during a stopover in Kuala Lumpur, Warnakulasuriya was then asked to disembark the plane at her final destination on her own. The statement of claim says that \"when the Plaintiff was on board the aircraft... she stood up un-assisted following the refusal of a flight attendant to provide a wheelchair or manual assistance.\" \"When she got to the other end she waited for all the passengers to clear the plane,\" Wheeler told the MailOnline. \"\'She was told something to the effect of \'there isn\'t a wheelchair you\'ll have to get that at the exit\'.\" But the elderly woman was not able to walk on her own and when she stood up to leave the plane her right leg, which she had injured earlier, collapsed beneath her. \"As soon as she stood up she fell back to the ground, her right knee and leg collapsed, she fractured her tibia, and there was ligament damage,\" Wheeler said. Court documents were filed over the incident requesting compensation from Malaysia Airlines to the sum of $ 250,000. Wheeler said his client is seeking to cover the costs of her ongoing medical treatment, and although Malaysia Airlines extended her return ticket so she could recover before returning to Australia, they have denied liability for the accident. Malaysia Airlines sources told the MailOnline the company \"is aware of the incident and as litigations are underway will not be commenting further\". ',No
'The incomparable benefits of Green Tea','A pioneer in every aspect of green tea processing and marketing, having established and managed a number of green tea factories in Sri Lanka as incredible success stories. Tiran Peiris’ passion for the industry made him an authority in the industry from the nursery up to shelf. Indeed, he is obsessed with the quest for creating genuine awareness of the incalculable benefits of the “miracle brew” commonly known as “green tea”. He intends doing so on a widest possible scale. Trained in the intricacies of the green tea in Japan, China as well as to Taiwan, Indonesia, Vietnam, India and Korea to expanding on a wider range of similar products. In the area of international marketing and has covered almost all the main exhibitions and trade fares in the globe. Currently, he is responsible for the operations and marketing of over 800 metric tonnes of green tea per annum as the Deputy MD and CEO of Melfort Green Teas (Pvt) Ltd and Consultant Pussellawa Plantations Ltd., which claims to be the market leader in the country. Under his leadership Melfort was selected as the “overall Winner” in the green tea category at the “specialty Tea Contest” held in USA at the “World Tea Expo” in 2008. Products such as Sanquhar Sencha Fannings was selected for the finals of the “World Tea Expo” in 2008. Melfort Green Teas won the Gold Award in Russia in 2011 along with Sanquhar selected for the finals. Peiris is a member of the World Green Tea Association based in Japan. Excerpts of an interview Q: How do you describe tea as a common drink? A: It was accidently invented by Shen Nong (father of tea) in 2737 BC and in Ceylon tea was grown commercially initiated by James Taylor a Scotsman, in Loolecondera estate in Hewaheta in 1867. It may be interesting to note that as far back in 1824 tea seeds have been brought to our island. In 1839 some seeds from China were planted in the Royal Botanical Gardens in Peradeniya for purely ornamental purposes. Hence Worms Brothers of Rothschild estate in 1841 are known to have planted tea even before Taylor. Tea is the most widely used drink next only to water at the global scale. Tea is a Chinese gift to humanity with a history of over 4700 years. In the scheme of things, it is the British who made Ceylon a tea producing nation and branded the best produce as Ceylon Tea. “Ceylon Tea is the Tea of Quality” was a popular slogan in those days of the British rule. Q: What is so special about Green Tea? A: The secret of green tea lies in the fact it is rich in catechin polyphenols, particularly epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG). EGCG is a powerful anti-oxidant: besides inhibiting the growth of cancer cells also it kills cancer cells without harming healthy tissue.. Having enough antioxidants in your diet means that your organs are able to react to some conditions much quicker. For example, your skin cells are rebuilt at a faster rate if you have more antioxidants in your body. Also, your internal organs function at a better efficiency – mainly the liver and kidneys, which will be better protected against most of their associated diseases as well. Add to that the fact that green tea contains the most powerful antioxidants known to man, is why it’s so healthy and useful. Q: How you have become a great advocate of green tea? A: I have a passion for tea and my involvement in the industry is more than 30 years. Tea in any form has immense health benefits. But green tea takes an incredible quantum leap. I will give you some medically proven reasons. Green tea helps to reduce the risk of cancer. The antioxidant in the product is 100 times more potent than vitamin C and 25 times better than vitamin E. It does so by helping the body at preventing cells from damage caused by cancer cells. Q: What are the benefits of green tea in heart diseases that is now rated as number one killer? A: Green tea prevents heart deceases and strokes by lowering the levels of the “bad cholesterol”. Once a person comes out of a heart attack green tea prevents further cell deaths and enhances the recovery of heart cells. Q: Can you elaborate of more medical marvels of the brew? A: Green tea is an active anti-aging agent as it contains antioxidants called polyphenol which combats free radicals in the body, thereby reducing the aging process. It may also be pertinent to recommend to all those who are struggling with body weight problems as green tea burns fat fast and increases the body’s metabolic rate. Remember it can burn up to 70\% of calories in just a single day. This means that there is a reduction of 7 lbs a week. While we are dealing with the size of the body let us consider the effects of green tea on the human skin. Again it is the free radicals in one’s body that causes skin wrinkles and signs of aging. Green tea not only reverses this process but also helps to fight skin cancer. Q: What more values does green tea has? A: Let me enumerate. It prevents and reduces rheumatoid arthritis. It does so by blocking the enzyme that destroys cartilage. Further it provides high levels of fluorides that enables bones to become stronger by preserving the bone density. Of course Diabetes is controlled by green tea by improving lipid and glucose metabolism. Further the polyphenols and polysaccharides help lower blood sugar. Thereby the sharp increase in sugar levels is controlled. Q: Can you give us a list of other medical benefits from green tea? A: Let me give you a list of health issues which green tea prevents, fights or reverses; Alzheimer’s disease, liver disease, food poisoning (by killing bacterial and eliminating toxins), cold, flu, asthma, ear infection, herpes, tooth decay, HIV and allergies. It also boosts immunity and helps reduce stress. Q: We have heard about the specifically immense advantages of Ceylon green tea. Please explain? A: Ceylon green tea has a higher content of anti oxidant compared to other origins. It is the cleanest green tea in the world. It is also the only ozone friendly green tea in the world Q: How many cups of green tea do you recommend? A: Three to four cups per day as minimum. Q: What is the correct way of brewing green tea? A: Two gms for every 150 ml of water boiling at 60c -80c. Make the brewing time 3 minutes. Then it is just right. Q: Let us now move on to another aspect of your work. Briefly tell us about Melfort Green Teas (MGT) and Sanquhar green teas)? A: It is a team oriented establishment of which I am privileged to initiate and lead. Ours is a lean organization where a few achieve more by their “smart work” and where a high motivational level exists needed at all the time. So much so that during the period of global recession in the recent past, we reaped substantial profits. Obviously we have consistently declared higher dividends to our share holders as well. Q: Do you offer any specialty green tea to the market? A: Yes, indeed a range of specialty products. We have applied for “patent rights” for a product identified as “Tencha” which involves minimum processing and possesses a higher content of anti oxidants. This Product is being produced in Sanquhar. Remember green tea from Sri Lanka has been acknowledged by international buyers for its unique characteristics. Q: What is the status of our green tea in the world market? A: This is a good question especially in view of the intense competition which we see for our traditional black tea. In reality, for Ceylon green tea in the global scene, sky is the limit. The sooner our decision makers at the highest levels realize it, it is better for the economy of the country. However, the price is a problem compared to other origins. Q: What is the future of Melfort and Sanquhar? A: The future is good, despite the import of green tea in large volumes. We are working with the Industrial Technology Institute for a sugar free energy drink based on green tea. Q: Finally, what is the reason of your success story? A: Working smart is the foundation. As human beings, we have our limitations. We cannot achieve all our aspirations. I strongly believe our success is based on “God’s blessings”.

'Falling tree spares workers damages tree wheeler, motorcycle','A group of road construction workers narrowly escaped injury by running away in time when a huge tree fell on the work site. The falling tree damaged a motorcycle and three-wheeler parked at the site. An 18-year-old female in a nearby house too injured in this incident rushed to Badulla General Hospital. Strong winds uprooted a roadside tree at a place on Uva Jayagama road in the Haali Ela area off Badulla where about 15 workers were repairing the road at the time of the incident on Monday, a report said, adding that the workers ran away on seeing the tree falling on them and avoided an accident. A motorcycle and a three-wheeler parked at the scene were damaged while a girl aged 18 at a nearby house too was injured. She was admitted to the Badulla General Hospital. The fallen tree blocked the traffic and road clearing work was being carried out, the Disaster Management Centre in Badulla said. ',Yes
'Galle Road renovation to be finalised by year end','The renovation program of the Galle Road will be finalised in the last quarter of the year, Postal Services Minister Jeevan Kumarathunga said. The renovation program of the Galle Road from Ratmalana to Moratuwa has been accelerated under a World Bank program, he said. Minister Kumarathunga addressing a meeting at the Moratuwa Divisional Secretariat recently, said the program is designed to prevent accidents as well. The Galle Road is constantly blocked by irregular vehicle parking where traffic jams also occur on the Galle Road. The authorities plan to introduce special places for parking vehicles to control and reduce the problem, he said. The minister said in addition, some points of the sewage system were blocked. A systematic program will be introduced to solve this problem soon. Entering the main road from sub roads have become difficult due to the increased level of the Galle Road. Those tributary roads will also be renovated about 50 metres from the main road to make it easy for vehicles to approach the Galle Road, Kumarathunga said. A guarded fence will be built on both sides of the road. Along with the fixing of the guarded fence, a sapling planting program will also be launched. Pedestrian crossings will be marked and new colour lights fixed as part of the renovation program, the minister said. Moratuwa Mayor Saman Lal Frenando, Moratuwa Divisional Secretary K. C. Niroshan and former Western Provincial Council member Morris Wijerathna also participated. ',No
'BLOODY WELL!','The blood that flows through our veins is so precious, that it is life itself. As miraculous as it is, we, in our day to day lives don\'t fully comprehend how wonderful it is, until we need it. As children, our parents are two of the most powerful people in our lives. But do you know that 800 mothers die every day during pregnancy, childbirth or in the postpartum period - 99 percent in the developing world? Severe bleeding during delivery or after childbirth is the commonest cause of maternal mortality and contributes to around 31 percent of maternal deaths in Asia. World Blood Donor Day which fell on June 14 focuses on providing safe blood for saving mothers. Sri Lanka is the host for the global event. Blood is one of the greatest gifts you can give a person. There is nothing commercial about it. It is a selfless act of compassion, to help someone who needs blood. Anyone can need blood. Blood is blood. It is not confined to a specific gender, race or religion. It is what makes us one human species - one human race. One human family on this rock called earth. We all have loved ones on this earth. It is what really helps us relate to others - love. As you love your mother, then understand the love another has for his or her mother. Understand that your blood can make a difference. Blood transfusion has been identified as one of the key life- saving interventions for the management of pregnancy related complications. Around 15.6 million units of blood donations are collected in WHOs (World Health Organization) South East Asia region every year. The region needs 18 million units of donations per year. \"Sri Lankans donate around 380,800 units of blood every year and 100 percent of donated blood comes from voluntary, non- remunerated donors. Sri Lanka has demonstrated strong political will and effective community mobilization, which has resulted in comprehensive nationally coordinated blood transfusion services,\" said WHO Regional Director for South East Asia, Dr. Poonam Khetrapal Singh. Host country Dr. Singh maintained that Sri Lanka was chosen as the host country to celebrate the World Blood Donor Day because in the region (South East Asia Region) Sri Lanka\'s maternal mortality rate is the lowest. There are other countries who are also doing well, but their statistics do not match Sri Lanka\'s. \"The South East Asia region consists of 11 countries. Some of them are very large and some of them are small, and there is a lot of diversity in the countries. Therefore the health indicators of these countries are also very different. India is the most populated country in our region and the second most populated country in the world. It has 28 states where the health indicators are very different. So we wanted to go to a country which is doing well. We wanted to be representative of the region, so we wanted to showcase what is happening in Sri Lanka, where the health indicators are amongst the best, matching those of the developed world.\" The endeavor to ensure safe blood for people is not without difficulty. There are infections such as what came out of Pandora\'s box - HIV, Hepatitis, Syphilis and Malaria. \"Countries need to ensure that supplies of blood and blood products are sufficient and free from infections. We need more people to donate blood voluntarily, for free, and to ensure the safety of blood during transfusions,\" said Singh. Martin Luther King Jr. said that anyone can be great because anyone can serve. Giving blood is a service. It is simple, and the satisfaction of helping is greater than a monetary reward. Safest group of donors An adequate and reliable supply of safe blood can only be assured through a stable base of regular, voluntary, unpaid blood donors. They are the safest group of donors as generally the prevalence of blood borne infections is lowest among them. WHO urges member states to develop national blood transfusion services based on voluntary, unpaid blood donations, to achieve the goal of self- sufficiency in safe blood and blood products. Voluntary donations are increasing, and account for almost 82 percent of total blood donations in the region. Other than Sri Lanka, only Thailand receive 100 percent of their blood by voluntary donations. Sometimes blood transfusions are often used for pregnancy related complications and injuries due to accidents and trauma. According to Dr. Singh, when simple and safe alternative treatments might be equally effective, such a transfusion may not be necessary. An unnecessary transfusion exposes patients to the risk of infections such as HIV and Hepatitis and adverse transfusion reactions. Is it any wonder that the heart is considered the seat of compassion? After all is it not the heart that pumps blood? Maybe the sight of seeing a smile on the face of someone who has benefited from a blood transfusion, can melt the hardest of hearts. Voluntary blood donation \"We have already achieved a 100 percent voluntary blood donation. We test the blood collected for HIV, Hepatitis C, Hepatitis B, Malaria and Syphilis. In most of the countries they do not have that facility as they check only for three diseases, but in Sri Lanka we check for five diseases. We have strengthened the safety of blood by introducing the newest technology - nuclear testing. We are also happy with our manpower and we have qualified specialists in transfusion medicine, with enough number of nurses and medical officers. We also have 90 hospital blood banks all over the country. We also want to acquire new technology for the national blood center,\" said Director, National Blood Transfusion Service, Ministry of Health, Dr. Anil Dissanayake The Quality and Safety has been ensured in Sri Lanka. 90 blood banks have been set up all over the country. There is a network of blood transfusion services/ outlets in major tertiary and secondary care institutions in the country. That itself will improve access. To further strengthen the blood transfusion services, state of the art blood banks will be set up at the regional level as well as the major hospital level. So a lot of measures have been taken to improve access. At the end of the day it comes down to love and that the better angels of our nature will prevail. ',No
'Special driving licence for passenger transport','The Transport Ministry has decided to introduce a special driving licence for drivers engaged in passenger transport vehicles. Transport Deputy Minister Rohana Kumara Dissanayake told the Daily News that Motor Traffic Department (MTD) officials will make this special driving licence for passenger transport vehicles compulsory. The main objectives of this program are to minimise the numbers of traffic accidents caused by the passenger transport service and create professional passenger service drivers in the future, he said. \"Passenger transport drivers must have a separate driving licence, particularly, those of buses, school children and staff transporting vehicles as they have a huge responsibility with the lives of many in their hands,\" he said. The deputy minister said to address this problem, Transport Ministry officials will introduce a new set of guidelines which is mandatory when issuing licence to passenger transport drivers in the future. The guidelines are expected to come into effect from January 1, 2015. According to the new law, all drivers in passenger transport vehicles including CTB and private buses, motor coaches as well as school vans and staff transport vehicles will be compelled to possess this special license in the future. \"The following requirements and qualifications shall be fulfilled by an applicant to obtain a special endorsement to drive a motor coach as a passenger transport service vehicle. The applicant should prove to the Commissioner General of the MTD that he is aged between 23 and 65 ( both inclusive); has obtained two years driving experience after having obtained a regular driving licence for a motor coach; has obtained a medical certificate issued by the National Transport Medical Institute or any other institution authorised by the Commissioner General; has completed a first aid course conducted by the National Transport Medical Institute or any other institution authorised in writing by the Commissioner General to conduct such course; has passed the medical knowledge examination conducted by the Commissioner General or any other institution authorised by him on that behalf; has successfully completed a training course conducted by an institution authorised by the Commissioner General to conduct such training course and has no criminal record in Sri Lanka\".

Any Computer on the internet can access another computer on any network, e.g.ATMs withdrawal of money from an account from any place. With the development of Mobile Phone technology m-Commerce has been improved, e.g. Mobile banking, reservation of Air Tickets through mobile phone etc. All Computers and related systems are vulnerable to intrusion and destruction. Perhaps, interruption of such system could lead to a total disruption of the daily life. Trends are developing to shift nature of crimes from traditional to Hi-Tech. Computer / Network may be used as a tool to commit a crime or storage. It is estimated that in near future, most of the crimes in the world will be Computer related crimes and documents will be Computer based documents. Therefore, application of new methodology to investigate and seizure of data in Computer hardware, software, communication devices, computer peripherals or any other forms and storing of them are essential. Its forensic issues and introduction of new laws relating to Computer evidence play a vital role in forwarding Evidence before Courts of Law. Main areas of the Information Technology Law. 1. Computer Crime 2. e-Commerce and Dispute Resolution 3. ICT related Intellectual Property Rights 4. Employer-employee relationship under Information Society 5. Computer Evidence and its Forensic Issues. Computer crimes: Computer crimes may be- 1. Computer related offences - accused used the computer/network as tool/s to commit offences. 2. Computer integrated offences - committed offences through computer/system/program 3. Contents related offence - change/destroy data introducing computer virus/worm etc. Another classification - Computer Integrated or non-integrated Why we cannot deal Computer based offences with existing and traditional criminal offences? E.g:- Main ingredient to fulfill the offence, \'Theft\' is involvement of movable property (which is tangible). See Nagaiya vs.Jayasekera 28 NLR 467 for Intangible property involved in Theft of electricity, Oxford vs.Moss [1978] 68 Cr.App.Reports 183 for Data. See Cox vs.Riley (1986) 83 Cr.App.R 54 for involvement of valuable article under offence of Theft. Long awaited Computer Crimes Act has been enacted by the Parliament of Sri Lanka in 2007. Section 2 of the Act gives a wide scope to the Act. Provisions of the Act apply, Even (a) a person while being present outside Sri Lanka commits an offence under the Act, (b) the computer system of information was to be affected was outside Sri Lanka, (c) facility or service used in the commission of an offence under the Act was outside Sri Lanka and (d) loss or damage caused within or outside Sri Lanka; by the commission of an offence under this Act to a person resident outside Sri Lanka have been inserted to the Act. Part I of the Act explains the offences under the Act and Section 3 deals with unauthorised access to (computer hacking) any computer or information held in any computer and introduces punishment for the same. Section 4 of the Act has introduced the offence of unauthorised access with an intention to commit an offence (computer cracking) and punishment for the same. Explanations state that the mere turning on a computer is sufficient to fulfil access to any computer and it is not necessary to have unauthorised access directed at any particular program, data or computer, to access information held in any computer. Section 5 has introduced the offence of causing a computer to perform a function without lawful authority and same will result in unauthorised modification or damage or potential damage to any computer, computer system or computer program. Transmitting of virus to another organisation accidentally or negligently may be offences under this section. Section 6 deals with offences committed against national security, the national economy and public order causing a computer to perform a function.

Postal theory and Receipt theory under the Law of Contracts of sending mail is different from sending of e-mail. Under UNCITRAL Model Law, when the message received by the Service Provider of the Receiver, presumption is that the receiver received the message. This is important due to the nature of travelling e-mail from one place to another. Principles on Exemption clauses, Misinterpretation and illegal contracts under e-Commerce have to be interpreted considering nature of electronic transaction. Mode of payment : Soon after feeding password or PIN of the Credit card to the webpage on the monitor money transaction will be completed. PayPal, electronic cheques are some latest methods to use online payments. Electronic Transactions Act No.19 of 2006 Section 3 of the same Act states that no data message, electronic document, electronic record nor other communication shall be denied legal recognition, effect, validity or enforceability on the ground that it is in electronic form.

Unfair Competition - Linking, Deep Framing, Mouse trapping, Spamming etc Employer-employee relationship under Information Society As far as the said changes in the Information Society is concerned, it is not fair one to expect the employer to maintain and stick into traditional environment or methods like paper based documentation or sending letters through postal service without application of modern technology. However, adjustability upon suitability of the conversion of a working place from traditional system into a modern environment under Information Society can be a serious problem. In any given Employer-employee contract, there may be both express and implied terms govern the same contract. Most of such contracts prepared for working places influenced with new technology have included express flexibility and mobility clauses to face new challenges in any given trade or business. In general, it is the duty of the Employer to provide necessary training to get the employee/s\' competence and adjusted to new working conditions. There should be a mutual consent between Employer and employee to update applicability of the necessary skills, or knowledge of the employee for the establishment and to provide necessary guidance and training by the Employer to improve the same skills of the employee. If the employee is purposely refusing to gain necessary knowledge and show skills can lead to a fair dismissal. Under the principle of vicarious liability, Employer may be liable for the actions of his employees during the employment and the Employer has to pay damages on such occasions for the employees\' action. Further publication may be far wider through e-mail and Internet due to its nature causing more damages to the victim in a defamation case. Internet Service Provider (ISP) will be liable primarily as a publisher of defamatory statement of a third party, when ISP carries the same on its server a news group even the employee of the ISP were ignorant of a defamatory material. If the employee acting as an author in the course of his employment or for the purpose of the employer\'s business publishes a publication that is expressly prohibited to publish, the employer also may be liable upon vicarious liability for the said act of employee/s. Like sexual harassment, racial harassment through e-mail is another aspect in Information Society. Due to the nature of e-mail and Internet Communication, news groups, chat rooms etc., can create its own problems and a company is generally identified as the origin of e-mails and not the employee of the same company. Monitoring of emails and internet downloads and uploads during the working hours of the establishment is important in Information Society.

To be Continued [Questions and Answers] Minimum wages and overtime payment Question :What are the main laws in Sri Lanka relating to wages and overtime payments? - Tilakarathne Answer : Sri Lanka has two main laws relating to the payment and fixing of wages. These are: The Wages Board Ordinance of 1941, and The Shop and Office Employees Act of 1954. Wages include remuneration for the normal hours worked, as well as any remuneration due in respect of overtime work and paid holidays. Wages are determined using indicators in the Colombo Cost of Living Index (CCLI), and Cost of Living Allowance (COLA). The wage also includes the employer\'s contribution towards the Employees\' Provident Fund (EPF) and Employees\' Trust Fund (ETF). There is no fixed minimum wage in Sri Lanka, it is dependent on the trade to which it applies; however, the lowest minimum wage is approximately SLRs 6,000 (USD 65). Wages can be paid on daily, weekly, fortnightly or monthly basis. However, a wage period cannot exceed a month. Overtime payments According to Section 24 (d) of the Minimum Wage Ordinance, the issue of work on holidays and the wages for such work should be at a rate not less than the overtime rate. If an overtime rate has been pre-determined, then it should be one-and-a quarter times the rate normally applied to such work. Holidays with or without pay must be granted on a day within a specified number of days. In the case of any special class of workers, payment for their work must be not less than one and a half times the normal rate, without a substitute holiday. According to The Shop and Office Employees Act the period of work for a day is eight hours, and for a week it is forty five hours. Therefore any additional hours of work is considered overtime. However this provision is not applicable to managers and executives in a public institution. The method of calculation of overtime per hour is: Monthly Salary x 1.5 / 240 With regard to the overtime work of women and young persons, Section 67 of the Factories Ordinance considers any fraction less than half an hour as a period of half an hour and similarly any fraction greater than half an hour but less than a whole hour, actually as a whole hour of work. The penalty for non-payment of wages and overtime payments. Employers covered by the Wages Board Ordinance who fail to make overtime payments can be prosecuted in the Magistrate Court and similarly those employers covered by the Shop and Office Employees Act can be prosecuted in the Magistrate Court under Section 136 of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act. Under Section 3D Sub-section 2 of the Wages Board Ordinance, where an employer defaults on payments, the Commissioner can file action to recover wages, in the Magistrate Court and fined accordingly. Under the Shop and Office Employees Act (Sections 50 52), all offences under this Act may be tried summarily by a Magistrate and fined accordingly and in some cases, even imprisoned. Denial of wages You should contact your Trade Union representatives and inform them of the denial of wages. Your Union will then inform the Commissioner of Labour, who will after inquiring into the issue and if no other option is available to recover your wages, the Commissioner will file a case before the Magistrate Court. This legal action can also be taken by your Trade Union if you are a member. In the mercantile sector where employees are covered by the Shop and Office Employees Act; if wages are not paid, the Commissioner of Labour is empowered to intervene and recover same through legal action in terms of Sections 50, 51 and 52 of the Act. The errant employer will be charged in the Magistrate Court and Court is empowered to recover balance wages with a surcharge. The sources of information for this article are the Wages Board Ordinance (1941) and the Shop and Office Employees Act (1954).

'First FIFA World Cup','The 1930 FIFA World Cup was the inaugural FIFA World Cup, the world championship for men\'s national association football teams. It took place in Uruguay from July 13 to 30,1930. FIFA, football\'s international governing body, selected Uruguay as host nation, as the country was to celebrate the centenary year of its first constitution, and the Uruguay national football team had successfully retained their football title at the 1928 Summer Olympics. All matches were played in the Uruguayan capital, Montevideo, the majority at the Estadio Centenario, which was built for the tournament. Thirteen teams (seven from South America, four from Europe and two from North America) entered the tournament. Few European teams chose to participate because of the difficulty of traveling to South America. The teams were divided into four groups, with the winner of each group progressing to the semi-finals. The first two World Cup matches took place simultaneously, and were won by France and the United States, who defeated Mexico 4-1 and Belgium 3-0, respectively. Lucien Laurent of France scored the first goal in World Cup history, while American goalkeeper Jimmy Douglas posted the first official \"clean sheet\" in the tournament. Argentina, Uruguay, United States and Yugoslavia each won their respective groups to qualify for the semi-finals. In the final, hosts and pre-tournament favorites Uruguay defeated Argentina 4-2 in front of a crowd of 93,000 people, and became the first nation to win the World Cup. The first World Cup was the only one without qualification. Plenty of interest was shown by nations in the Americas; Argentina, Brazil, Bolivia, Chile, Mexico, Paraguay, Peru and the United States all entered. A total of seven South American teams participated, more than in any subsequent World Cup finals. However, because of the long and costly trip across the Atlantic Ocean, and the length of absence required for players, very few European teams were inclined to take part. Some refused to countenance travel to South America in any circumstances, and no European entries were received before the February deadline. In an attempt to gain some European participation, the Uruguayan Football Association sent a letter of invitation to the Football Association, even though the Home Nations were not members of FIFA at the time. This was rejected by the FA Committee on 18 November 1929. Two months before the start of the tournament, no team from Europe had officially entered. Replica of the trophy awarded to the winners FIFA president Jules Rimet intervened, and eventually four European teams made the trip by sea: Belgium, France, Romania, and Yugoslavia. The Yugoslavians were the youngest team in the World Cup; with an average age of 21 years and 258 days. After their first match, against Brazil, they received a new nickname \"The Ich-es\" or \"Ichachos\" (in Spanish) by the Uruguayan press; referring to most of the player\'s surnames that ended up with the \"-ic\" or \"-vic\" suffix, which is quite common for Serbian last names. They achieved the biggest success in both Yugoslav and Serbian subsequent World Cup footballing history, by earning the third place. A 1927 FIFA commission examined the possibility and on the eve of the following year\'s Amsterdam Olympics, FIFA\'s Congress voted to stage an inaugural world championship in 1930. The only remaining question was where. Italy, Netherlands, Spain, Sweden and Uruguay all expressed an interest but the Uruguayans alone were prepared to pay all travel and hotel expenses as well as build a new stadium at a time of economic uncertainty. Add the fact Uruguay would be celebrating its centenary that same year and FIFA duly plumped for the South Americans, confirming their decision at the 1929 Congress in Barcelona. An estimated 30,000 Argentines crossed the River Plate for the final on July 30, 1930. The gates of the Estadio Centenario opened in the early morning and by kick-off, 80,000 spectators had crammed inside. Argentina won the toss for their choice of match ball and, despite losing an early goal to the beret-wearing Pablo Dorado, they had the better of the first period, attacking with speed and intelligence and earning their reward with goals from Carlos Peucelle and Stabile. A newspaper report the next day recounted how the home players and their supporters had \"suffered a thousand deaths\" yet roused by their captain\'s half-time team talk, the Celeste responded. Cea and Victoriano Santos Iriarte restored the hosts\' lead before Hector Castro, who had lost an arm in a boyhood accident, removed any doubt with a minute remaining. Uruguay\'s players cried tears of joy as Nasazzi became the first man to hold aloft football\'s most prestigious prize. The FIFA World Cup was up and running. ',No

'Forgiving Frenchman','Srinath Christopher Samarasinghe.\r\n \t\t\tPicture by Sarath Peiries One might call him an expat but he\'d convince you of a life rooted to many places than one in particular. Born in Tehran and then moved in to Europe and now a proud French citizen, Srinath Christopher Samarasinghe has more to his life than the inter-continental marvel that his history possesses. Daily News managed to interview him while he was in Sri Lanka for the screening of his movie \'Un nuage dans un verre d\'eau (A cloud in a glass of water) on behalf of the French Spring Festival 2014. Q: Where did your \'world tour\' begin as a human being? A: I was born in 1978 in Tehran. My parents worked in a multinational firm and it wasn\'t the best place to live by the 1979 Iranian Revolution. And my parents moved to Germany, Italy and even Britain after that. I have even lived in Brussels and am a French citizen. But I haven\'t been to Sri Lanka. Q: Where were you as an amateur filmmaker? A: I\'m still a beginner when it comes to cinema. I\'ve done one feature film and two short films altogether. One of them was screened in the International Surrealist Film Festival. Q: What is it like being a film director in French society? A: It\'s an experience like no other. France is a multicultural society and though there\'s French nationalism in one hand, the diversity in the society is tremendous. It might look challenging for someone like me, but once you absorb the culture, the cuisine and \'Frenchness\' into your veins, it becomes a whole lot easier. In this movie I\'ve worked with a famous Egyptian actor and a Romanian actress with a French origin. Being in the French society makes it a lot easier to interact and work with people from different cultural backgrounds, as all those cultures are somewhat linked with it. Q: How does the industrial setup attract new talent in France? A: By basically taking care of the risk factor for them. There\'s a financial aid system called \'Avance Sur Recette\' which lets you approach them with your movie and they give an advance to you on the profit that you are expected to make from the movie (which is not to be paid back). It\'s aimed at creating an independent film industry that doesn\'t solely rely on market forces. That\'s beneficial for newcomers who are yet to establish a solid name for themselves. Q: Where do you see the difference lies in French and Hollywood cinemas? A: French cinema structure allows free space to discuss about many debated topics which don\'t get much recognition in the likes of Hollywood cinema. For example, France produces movies themed on transsexual issues to more culture related matters. In the same time it has produced all those popular kind of movies which makes it more versatile. Hollywood industry is more profit oriented with its structure it seems. Big budgeted movies come up and they are expected to earn big. Therefore, the subject matters ought to cater to that necessity. Q: How does this \'openness\' in French film industry become a possibility? A: When it comes to Hollywood, it\'s basically the investors that inject money into the industry. But in France, there\'s a body called \'Centre National de la Cinematographie\' (National Centre for Cinematography). It is funded by the money that comes from the movie industry itself and the money is reinvested into movies that discuss controversial and overlooked subjects which might not earn huge gains economically. But that way the cinema is rich with themes and creates a common platform to social issues. Q: Does language play a crucial role in a movie? A: Of course. For example, Hollywood has become invincible with a global audience that speaks English. Also there\'s a general dislike to read subtitles while enjoying the movie. But poignancy of the subject matters is capable of piercing through these barriers which is why there are many masterpieces which are made in other languages. Therefore, language is a vital element. But it\'s the not the only thing that decides the fate of a movie. Q: \'A cloud in a glass of water\', what inspired you to make the movie? A: It had something to do with a personal experience as well. When I was 4 years old ,an old person used to take care of me as my parents were busy with work and one day he was dead in our flat and that\'s the first time that I saw death. My mother explained to me with the glass and water example and said that the spirit is like water in a glass which equals human body , and when the glass is broken the water in it takes another form. There\'s a grandfather and a grandson who don\'t have a close relationship and the story runs through human conditions that govern the nuances that link each other. The movie is somewhat a mixture of a documentary and a fiction. Q: Since your work basically focuses on human life and conditions, what\'s your approach to those topics? A: Human emotions and mystical human conditions are my basic subject matters. I met with an accident a while ago, and I was in a coma when I literally saw my own body lying on the bed. That made me think of the fragile nature of human life and the way we let go the simplicity in life which matters eventually . With such experience, the need to forgive became a major subject matter of my work. Q: Any ideas on doing a Sinhala feature film in the future? A: At present I\'m working on a project which will be partially in Sinhala. And it will speak about the Sri Lankan society and hopefully my perspective would bring up a new twist to the everyday story that Sri Lankans get to hear. ',No

'Germany destroys Brazil’s Dream','Six minutes. That’s how long it took for the German national team to turn a full, rollicking Estádio Mineirão crowd of 58,000 or so into a silent-as-the-grave group of mourners. What they watched was the death of Brazil’s dream to win its first World Cup on its home soil in two tries. Thomas Müller put the Germans ahead, 1-0, in the 11th minute with a goal off a corner kick in which the forward was left entirely alone to score his fifth goal of this World Cup. But it wasn’t until 12 minutes later that the roof-almost literally-fell in on the host nation. First Miroslav Klose became the all-time leading goal-scorer in Cup history with 16. Then Toni Kroos scored a minute later; then Kroos again a minute after that; then, just three minutes after that, Sami Khedira got in on the fun. Goals 2 through 5 were scored via short, quick passes in the Brazilian penalty box that discombobulated the defense and left Brazilian keeper Julio César out of position. All the air went out of the stadium, Germany began to play more defensively, and while the Brazilians were able to mount effective attacks in the second half, so was Germany, which again broke through in the 69th minute with André Schürrle making the tally 6-0. Schürrle scored another goal-a beauty that caressed the underside of the crossbar-and then Oscar avoided the home side shutout by scoring in stoppage time to make it 7-1. But it was still the worst defeat in Brazilian national team history since Uruguay beat them 6-0 at the South American Championship of 1920. Brazil was missing its best player, Neymar, whose back was badly injured in the closing minutes of the quarterfinal match against Colombia. Not that he would have bolstered the defense appreciably. The player who might have was their captain and starting center back, Thiago Silva, who was sitting out for multiple yellow cards. But the German bombardment makes it hard to believe that any one player would have made much of a difference. Brazil, the country with the most Cup victories, hasn’t won one now since 2002. Germany, which last won the tournament in 1990, as West Germany, now faces the winner of Wednesday’s semifinal between Argentina and the Netherlands on Sunday, July 13 for the championship.

'Brazil’s World Cup campaign comes to a miserable end','Brazil\'s World Cup campaign came to a miserable end as the hosts were convincingly beaten by the Netherlands in the third-place play-off. Goals from Robin van Persie, Daley Blind and Georginio Wijnaldum condemned Brazil to back-to-back defeats on home soil for the first time since 1940, following Tuesday\'s embarrassing 7-1 loss to Germany in the semi-final. As an added insult, Brazil must now watch on as their fiercest rivals Argentina take on Germany for the chance to win the World Cup at Brazilian football\'s spiritual home, the Maracana, on Sunday. Having backed their side so vocally throughout, home supporters turned on Brazil on Tuesday, cheering opposition attacks and directing loud boos at their own players, and their frustration continued in the capital, Brasilia. Brazil\'s World Cup of woe Coach Luiz Felipe Scolari bore the brunt of their anger, and his long-term future as national team boss is now in doubt. Brazil\'s fans had packed homes, bars and fan parks to watch the action, leaving streets near empty, but the shock defeat by Germany left a question mark over how they would greet their team before Saturday\'s game. There was little indication in the build-up that their interest had wavered, as thousands descended on the Copacabana beach fan park in Rio de Janeiro, while the Estadio Nacional was close to capacity. When the teams emerged from the tunnel to go through their pre-match warm-ups, the players were greeted by loud cheers, which increased in volume when injured talisman Neymar appeared. The striker - who scored four goals before a back injury ruled him out of the Germany debacle - was wearing a full training kit, but watched from the bench as his team-mates went onto the pitch. Fans were determined to support their team It seemed the Brazilian fans were determined to support their team, but they also made it known they had not forgotten the defeat by Germany as loud boos rang out when the names of Scolari and beleaguered striker Fred were read out. Fred was one of six starters against Germany who were relegated to the bench against the Netherlands, and several players from Brazil\'s 23-man squad are likely to have played in their last World Cup. Whatever the future does hold, it was briefly forgotten about before Saturday\'s game as players and fans once again sang the Brazil national anthem in unison. It was as rousing a rendition of the anthem as any throughout the tournament, but thoughts of redemption lasted barely three minutes, when Brazil captain Silva pulled back Robben and the referee awarded a penalty, which Van Persie expertly converted. The home fans were stunned into silence, but it was to get worse barely 15 minutes later when they conceded a second. This time defender David Luiz headed a tame clearance straight to Blind and the Dutch midfielder found the top corner for his first international goal. Brazilian faces were sullen, perhaps fearful of similar capitulation that saw Brazil concede five goals in just 18 minutes against Germany. They improved as the half wore on, but it was not enough for the players to avoid being booed as they left the field at the break. The game slowed to a pedestrian pace in the second half, with Brazil fans continuing to boo Scolari every time the big screen in the stadium showed the 65-year-old\'s face. Ramires flashed a shot wide before Oscar was booked for diving as Brazil strived for some way back into the game. Instead, though, Wijnaldum completed another miserable defeat for Scolari\'s side with a third in stoppage time. Echoing full-time in the defeat by Germany, the final whistle was greeted with a huge chorus of boos. It was a positive send-off for departing Netherlands boss Louis van Gaal as he embarks on his next assignment, as manager of Manchester United. But for Brazil, a tournament that started with optimism and promise for the five-time winners ended in frustration. BBC ',No

'[Children] 17.07.2014','“All you have to do is write one true sentence. Write the truest sentence that you know.” - Ernest Hemingway  Words of wisdom Dear Children, I know that all of you are into writing, reading and drawing. It is good that you picked up that good habit since your small days. Other than the essays and poems that you send us, have you written any stories or poems on your own for school magazines? Some of you must have done that. Keep up the good work. Each of us has a story to tell. Whoever you come across in society may have an inspirational story to share with you. Not only that, the oceans, the rivers, valleys, the sun, the moon, thickets, mountains and stars are ever ready to stand as metaphors and symbols for the stories you are ready to pen. I have often told you that the oceans are as vast as our lives. The rivers in its long journey towards the ocean are symbolic of human lives. The mountain is a symbol of courage, patience, effort and endurance. The sun and the moon are symbols of integrity and honesty. What about the inspirational people whom you have met in your life? Your grandparents, your neighbours, your teachers, beggars, people whom you meet accidentally on the road, may be in the grocery or at a party or while you are on a trip could perhaps be the theme of your stories. Similarly the animals - your pet dog, cat, cow, birds that roam freely in your garden, the squirrels that run to and fro on the trees of your garden and the butterflies of myriad colours too will provide inspiration for your creative work. Your favourite writers may vary from Martin Wickramasinghe to J.K.Rowlings. Today with advancement of technology you have several ways of reading books. There are plenty of interesting sites and e books on the internet. You better use them. There are so many blogs, and facebook pages that provide you fine tips on writing. Make use of all these sources, but try to be independent when penning your own story. As you write your stories, remember that being original is the most important thing. That means your story is unique, nobody else has written it before. However as I have written to you earlier too, all our stories are based on common feelings- love, sadness, fear, happiness, laughter and expectations. Hence each story has relevance to all of us. Today most of you are more familiar with your PC or laptop than the pen and book. But remember during the days of your grandparents computer and other novel methods were not even heard of. So they used to write with a pen. Whatever the mode you use, your story would be the same. So doesn’t matter whether you use pen or PC, what I need to see is more of your creative work. I am sure that you will never disappoint aunty Sanju. Happy writing!

The Sri Lankan cup of Golden Tea As you wend your way through Sri Lanka’s hill country, the nip in the air makes your skin tingle. Your eyes glide over a Shangri-la of mist and tea covered hillsides, and all at once you long for the steaming satisfaction of a cup of tea. What better refreshment than a pitcher of iced tea, a slice of lemon floating lazily on top, should you have just flung yourself onto a sandy shore, deliciously invigorated by a swim. For Sri Lankans and people the world over tea is a versatile beverage that is drunk hot or cold, with or without milk, at all hours of the day, surprising then to learn that the short stubby plant which has brought renown to Sri Lanka is actually not native to the island. It was only in 1867 that tea was planted in the country, by James Taylor at Loolecondera Estate, near the old hill kingdom of Kandy. Tea clearly seems to be a drink for all times and places. In the last decade, Sri Lanka grabbed the top spot as the world’s largest tea exporter.

'What do the Buddhists want from the Muslims?','The above question was asked by a Muslim friend of mine after the Aluthgama Beruwala incidents. At that time the Minister Hakeem was trying to score points over the Sinhala Buddhists and he has now threatened the latter by claiming that unless the Bhikkus are controlled there could be Muslim extremist organisations. Imposing an unofficial “blackout” on the news gave Hakeem and others a free hand to spread the usual anti Sinhala Buddhist line among the Muslims. It appears that Hakeem is of the view that some organisations would get foreign aid to engage in extremist activities. As we have argued elsewhere, no individual or organisation should be allowed to engage in political activities with foreign “aid” and it should apply to “Hakeem’s Muslim extremist organisations” as well. Hakeem’s idea of controlling the Bhikkus is against the culture of the country, and by that statement alone he has shown his anti Buddhist attitudes. Collective responsibility We have enough experience with the Tamil racists some of whom eventually became extremists and finally terrorists with foreign “aid”. The ideology, finance, equipments including arms were supplied by foreigners with many Western Governmental Organisations (WGOs, so called NGOs) involved in various capacities. The Tamil racism is more than two hundred years old and is still thriving with the dispersed Tamils and WGOs being used by the Western countries to destabilize Sri Lanka and replace the “Rajapaksa regime” with a “Ranil regime” that would dance to the tune of the West. We should not allow Hakeem or any other person to push Sri Lanka to another “war”, but if that is what Hakeem wants the Sinhala people would not jump to the Indian Ocean or even Nilwala Ganga down south in desperation. In Sri Lanka we have evolved a unique Cabinet tradition, where so called collective responsibility is not found. It is not necessary to follow the Western Cabinet traditions, very often found only in textbooks, and we should allow the Cabinet ministers to speak their own minds in public. We now know where each Cabinet minister stands with respect to policy, even though the policy implemented is what is taken at Cabinet meetings not necessarily by consensus. There is no room for consensus, as there is no national policy as such. BBS members Though Hakeem tries to frighten the Buddhists with talk of extremist Muslim organisations, they are already here, as people know of activities in “Muslim Enclaves”. It is unfortunate that on certain days the law of the country is not respected in these “enclaves” and with an incident such as a motor accident the “enclaves” come to their own. There were some Tamil leaders who were prepared to accept the fact that there were Tamil extremist organisations but I have not come across any Muslim who would accept that there is Muslim extremism even today. Recently a Bhikku known to me for more than thirty years, and who associates with the Muslim Maulavis and others told me that the latter would never admit that there is a Muslim aggression with Muslim extremist elements involved. Of course, one would say that there is no need for any Muslim to admit that there is Muslim extremism, aggression in the country when there is no such phenomenon in the country. The average Sinhala person, whom I know has felt this aggression and one should not think of Bodu Bala Sena (BBS) as an isolated phenomenon without any mass support. There may be some “educated” Buddhists who contribute to newspapers on the “Bhikku image” and whether it is proper for a Bhikku to behave the way that some of the Bhikku leaders of some organisations are projected in the news media. The majority of the Buddhists whom I associate differs from these “educated types” and do not speak against the BBS. It is not the number of BBS members that count but the support that they have from the general public. One should not go by the letters to the editor by the “educated types” and think that the activities of BBS are condemned by the majority of the people. Whether the BBS is supported by the government or not it exists as there is a “demand” for these organisations, especially when the government is restricted by certain “international” conditions. Only on Wednesday I met a “Unani” intern who wore the black Muslim traditional “cloak”, and I was able to explain to her that the Sinhala people consider the “purdah” or the “cloak” as a symbol of Muslim aggression. About twenty five years ago these “purdahs” were not seen on the streets in Sri Lanka, and even today in Malaysia, Indonesia, Bangladesh, Pakistan, Maldives to name a few Asian countries outside Western Asia the “traditional purdah” is not worn by the Muslim ladies as much as in Sri Lanka. The dress can be a weapon used by political movements and as far as the Sinhalas are considered the “purdah” has become an expression of Muslim aggression. Preserving cultural values The Sinhala people would not object to Muslims having their own identity, and preserving the cultural values. However, in the process, the Muslims do not have to be “Arabian Muslims”. As Ven. Galabodaaththe Gnanasra Thera has said recently it is the Sinhala people who are the original inhabitants of the country and they are the people who evolved a culture unique to the country. I do not agree with the Thera when he says, probably following Mahavamsa that the Sinhala people colonized the country. My view of history is different from what is stated in Mahavamsa as I am of the opinion that the Sinhala people are descendants of Yagu Kaurana (Yaksha) and other gothras (not tribes in the Western sense) who had been living in this country for more than at least five thousand years as established by the excavations of Prof. Raj Somadeva and others, and of course Vedic or Ardha Vedic people who arrived about two thousand five hundred years ago. The Yagu Kauranas had become Buddhists during the time of Budunvahanse as stated in Varigapurnikava and also confirmed by the excavations of Prof. Somadeva, and had established what may be called Hela Buddhist culture. This culture has been incorporated in the Sinhala Buddhist culture probably by the fifth century and anybody who came to this blessed island had been absorbed to this culture. The origin of the Vedda community is not well known but they have had their own culture without being a threat to the Sinhala Buddhist culture. Sinhala Buddhist culture When the Muslims came to this country from present South India they would have come as Tamil speaking Muslims or even Tamil Muslims. As they had come in large numbers or due to some other reason they had not been absorbed in to the Sinhala Buddhist culture and had remained as a separate entity as in the case of Vedda community. I do not buy the story that they came from Arab and married Sinhala women and spoke with their offspring in Tamil and not in Sinhala or Arabic. The Tamil Muslims or Tamil speaking Muslims if the Muslims prefer that way, had not worn the traditional Muslim dresses in Sri Lanka as the climate in Sri Lanka or present South India is not suitable for that dress. Only a few years ago the Muslim ladies wore the sari with the “sari pota” over their heads and thus identifying themselves as Muslims. The sari/osari, have been the dress worn by the Sinhala ladies (at least the elite Menikes) when going out even before the time of Anagarika Dharmapala and what the latter did was to “democratize” the dress so that not so elite ladies also wore the sari/osari. Probably the Muslim ladies followed suit or continued with the sari that they brought from present South India, with the sari pota over the head. To cut a long story short, what the Buddhists want from the Muslims is for them to behave as Sri Lankan Muslims and not as Arabian Muslims. The Buddhists have borrowed from the Muslims, especially from the recently migrated Malay Muslims, and are proud of these cultural absorptions. The Muslims on their part have absorbed from the Sinhala Buddhist culture and the cultures should not only be threats to other countries but should not appear to be so. What we should aim at is the evolution of a Sri Lankan culture unique to this country with of course differences that would maintain the “Buddhistness”, “Muslimness”, “Christianness” etc. In this regard I should mention that in the Universities of Colombo and Kelaniya, I told my Catholic students that they should strive to be Sri Lankan Catholics (Sinhala or Tamil Catholics) and not Roman Catholics. The Muslims in Sri Lanka should be Sinhala or Tamil Muslims (Sri Lankan Muslims) and not Arabian Muslims. ',No

'READ BEFORE YOU CONCLUDE...','A downing of a civilian aircraft by gunfire is a serious matter, and the human toll sickens many of us to the bone. It is also an ill portend for the aviation industry which is not served well when there are two major crashes involving passenger aircraft that belong to one particular airline company in the business. But, does that mean that there should be an immediate declaration of war or a declaration of intent of going to war -- when rigor mortis has not quite set in on the bodies of the civilian dead? The exact circumstances of the crash of the Malaysian Airlines MH-17 has to be determined. It means that there should be a thorough investigation that is not prejudiced by newspaper and television reporting, irrespective of how credible sounding such dispatches might be. Though the immediate conclusion in most quarters is that flight has been shot down, and though that is probably correct, the haste to claim that its downing is as a result of a terrorist attack is precipitate and ill-considered. The passenger plane even if it was definitely brought down from the sky may have crashed due to an accidental shooting -- which even though not pardonable, is not the same as a terrorist attack. If it is an accidental shooting that\'s the cause, it could be the work of one of several parties or at least any of two in the current Ukrainian conflict. There are many possibilities, and jumping to conclude that one country or that country\'s President is involved is ludicrous, and says more about those who aim such charges than about those who are targeted. The former US Secretary of State and prospective presidential candidate Hillary Clinton has already opined in a television broadcast beamed from the US that if the Russians are responsible, it is a serious infarction of international law and that \'there will be a price to pay.\' It takes two sides to precipitate a conflict to say the very least, and even if so called Russian backed insurgents shot down the aircraft by accident -- that is not necessarily a calamity that has to be laid at the Russian President\'s door. What\'s depressing is when, to reiterate, before rigor mortis sets in, there are parties ready to rattle their sabres and play politics which is, to put it mildly, rather disrespectful of the hundreds that died as a result of this unfortunate crash. It is when a person such as Hillary Clinton who though now not a public official still is closely identified with the US Establishment gets rather loquacious, that terms such as False Flag, though rather cautiously used at the worst of times, spring to mind. There isn\'t much of a need to elaborate except to state that many neutral observers are skeptical when petty political theatre seems to be the first reaction to the crisis, and questions are asked later. It seems that many, Clinton included, are gung-ho or trigger happy, or both, and are talking in terms of making war on Russia as a result of the incident, which is worse than crashing a plane by mistake -- horrendous though that action may be. It is the preconceived nature of the narrative that is grating and it appears listening to some of the immediate reactions to the crash on television, that these breaking news broadcasts might have been carefully pre planned! At least, anyone who thinks that way has to be excused, when the sole intent of some of the program anchors and panelists seems to be to push just one political line which is to demonize Putin. The scale of the human tragedy, and the devastating reality for one airline company that two of its aircraft were involved in recent crashes, makes this incident over Ukrainian territory one that is serious enough to be investigated with a missionary zeal. What\'s happening unfortunately seems to be the exact opposite -- there is an effort to point everything in one direction and hold a trial by media, bizarre as it may sound in this day and age in which the truth has a way of surfacing despite all determined efforts to make sure that it does not... ',No
'Political parties called to condemn Israeli aggression in Gaza','The Sri Lanka Committee for Solidarity with Palestine invites representatives of the country\'s major political parties for a meeting on July 22 at 3.30pm at the Library Services Auditorium Colombo to jointly condemn the mass killing of civilians in the Gaza Strip, denounce the double standards of the major powers in the international community in upholding human rights, demand freedom for Palestine and its people from decades of illegal occupation and oppression. Co-Presidents of the Sri Lanka Committee for Solidarity with Palestine Athauda Seneveiratne and Imthiaz Bakeer Markar will preside at the meeting The Israeli assault on the impoverished and constricted Gaza Strip has killed 231 Palestinians, including 39 children and injured over 1,700. Homes, mosques, hospitals, a home for the differently-abled and public infrastructure have been destroyed by precision aerial attacks by Israel. Sri Lanka, for over a half a century, with the overwhelming majority of the international community has stood by calls for freedom for the Palestinian people and their right to resist an illegal occupation and oppression. As of 2013, Israel had been condemned in 45 resolutions by United Nations Human Rights Council since its creation in 2006. The Council had passed more resolutions condemning Israel than on the rest of the world combined. ',No
'Djokovic-Nadal Showdown again?','It\'s actually quite remarkable that Rafael Nadal and Novak Djokovic have met in the U.S. Open finals as the top two players in the world in two of the last three years. While it should be the odds-on-favorite matchup, recent history shows that No. 1 vs. No. 2 rarely happens at the U.S. Open. What makes it so difficult for the top two players to endure to the U.S. Open finals? Conversely, why is New York\'s final now unable to stop the exceptional tide that is Nadal vs. Djokovic? No. 1 vs. No. 2 at the Majors We recently featured Andre Agassi\'s 1995 duel with Pete Sampras as the top two players in the world. They both met in the U.S. Open final. One year later, No. 1 Sampras and No. 2 Michael Chang met for the title. From 1997-2010, 14 years, the top two seeded players did not meet in the U.S. Open final. This is particularly surprising because of the dominance of the current era\'s champions, Roger Federer, Nadal and Djokovic. When Federer was rewriting the record books at Flushing Meadows, Nadal failed to get through his half of the draw. Since, Nadal has been a finalist in all three years he has participated (injured and unable to play in 2012). He and Federer were ships passing in the night. Nadal\'s rise at the U.S. Open has coincided with Djokovic\'s ascension to the top of the tennis world. The Serbian has appeared four straight times in the final. Just how tough is it for the top two players to survive in New York? By comparison, Wimbledon featured No. 1 vs. No. 2 seven of the last 11 years. (2004-05 Federer vs. Andy Roddick; 2006-08 Federer vs. Nadal; 2011 Nadal vs. Djokovic; 2013 Djokovic vs. Murray.) The French Open has seen the top two seeded players meet five of the last nine years. (2006-08 Federer vs. Nadal; 2012 and 2014 Djokovic vs. Nadal.) The Australian Open also shows hard courts to be more of an equalizer than Paris and London. We get only two top pairings in 14 years. (2009 Nadal vs. Federer; 2012 Djokovic vs. Nadal.) So the fast courts at the U.S. Open have only produced a final with the top two players twice in 17 years. (2011 and 2013 Nadal vs. Djokovic.) Star-Crossed Rivalry Neither Nadal nor Djokovic have really ruled in peace because the other keeps coming back, as if they were cosmic enemies fated to clash and war until their careers went supernova. They are not just a prolific rivalry but a diabolical brotherhood like Thor and Loki, unable to coexist or escape from each other. Nadal vs. Djokovic is already the most prolific rivalry tennis has seen. Never mind that they have played each other 42 times (Nadal leads 23-19) and in 22 finals. They have also met six times in Grand Slam finals (at all four venues) as the top two players, including twice at the French Open and twice at the U.S. Open. For good measure, they also met in the 2010 U.S. Open final, with Djokovic seeded No. 3. It\'s no wonder that tennis fans come to expect this matchup. It has proved to be the most likely pairing in tennis history. Nadal is the king of clay, but Djokovic is currently the second-best player on this surface. Djokovic is great on hard courts, but it\'s Nadal\'s second surface. They are all-court warriors who realize they must usually destroy each other to take major titles. They are also resilient and possess unbreakable spirits. Unlike Agassi, Roddick and other stars-who could be broken or demoralized, often taking a long time to mount another charge-Nadal and Djokovic are willing to endure the suffering of losing. They find added motivation to keep coming back, hiding their painful brushstrokes beneath the time and effort to paint another masterpiece. Even so, it will be a long, tough road if they are to arrive at the U.S. Open final. It\'s the toughest tournament in tennis for several reasons. Street Tough in New York The tennis season never seems to end, and by the time the European Slams have concluded in early July. there is often a transition to heal from the physical and mental rigors of tennis. This might include vacation time, training or playing mid-level tournaments. But getting back to the most competitive grind of tennis is never easy, especially when the concrete surfaces of North America reflect scorching sun and unmercifully attack tender knees. From August to mid-September, The Canada Open, Cincinnati\'s Western and Southern Open and the U.S. Open is as much physical attrition as tennis skill. If Dante were still alive, he would have listed the North American swing as one of the circles of Hell. It\'s hard enough that the U.S. Open is the climax of summer heat and the center of raucous New York, where the fans are overly boisterous and ready to rumble. It was the one place that unnerved the legendary Bjorn Borg. Until late in his career, cool Stefan Edberg melted away like a cup of ice. Champions must be hard and durable, worthy to span boroughs and walk over water. There are dangerous big servers and baseline grinders. It\'s a forum for any style and tennis\' great equalizer. One sensational day from an early-round sleeper, and it could be all over for a top seed. BLEACHER REPORT ',No

'Israel takes out Gaza tunnels with excavators and airstrikes','ISRAEL: Israeli bulldozers on Saturday demolished more than a dozen tunnels the military said were being used by Hamas gunmen to sneak beneath the southern border of the Jewish state and carry out attacks on its soldiers and civilians. Palestinians reported intensified airstrikes and shelling as the death toll from Israel\'s ground offensive rose to over 350 Palestinians, including many civilians. Five Israelis - three soldiers and two civilians - have also been killed since the fighting began more than 10 days ago, and dozens of Israelis have been injured as Gaza rockets continue to rain down on Israeli cities. Israeli soldiers uncovered 34 shafts leading into about a dozen underground tunnels, some as deep as 30 metres, the military said. Israel views the tunnels as a strategic threat, and demolishing them is a high priority in their campaign. Still, Palestinian gunmen disguised in Israeli uniforms managed to infiltrate Israel from Gaza using another tunnel and on Saturday killed two Israeli soldiers and injured several others, the military said. At least one Palestinian was killed in the clash. Hamas said 12 of its fighters participated in the attack and that the group took some of the soldiers\' weapons back to their hideouts. In two other confrontations, Palestinian gunmen jumped out of tunnels and shot at soldiers who returned fire. Two of the gunmen were killed. Another militant died when the explosive vest he was wearing went off, the military said. In one instance, the militants were found with tranquilizers and handcuffs, indicating they \"intended to abduct Israelis,\" according to the military. It was the second day that Palestinians had used their network of underground tunnels to penetrate Israel in the current round of fighting. Israel embarked on its ground offensive on Thursday, the same day 13 heavily armed Palestinians sneaked through a tunnel from Gaza and emerged inside Israel near a southern community. The militants were killed by an airstrike after they popped out of the tunnel. Clashes persisted into late Saturday, with heavy fighting reported in several parts of Gaza. Shimon Daniel, a retired Brigadier General and former head of the Israeli military\'s engineer corps, said the military knew that Hamas had a large number of tunnels designed to assault Israel. \"I think finding 13 tunnels in such a short time is a great achievement,\" he told Channel 10 TV. He said demolishing the tunnels is dangerous. Troops must assume the passages are booby trapped. Soldiers first close off the area and check for additional openings. Then robots go inside to look around, he said. After that, the tunnels are destroyed either by special explosives or by heavy equipment. It can take up to 12 hours to destroy each tunnel. \"These tunnels aren\'t for hiding. They are intended for large attacks in Israeli communities and army bases,\" chief military spokesman Brig. Gen. Moti Almoz said. Footage released by the Israeli military showed tunnels being demolished by army excavators and other equipment on the ground and by airstrikes from above. Gaza Health Ministry spokesman Ashraf al-Kidra said the new round of airstrikes raised the death toll. Casualties could mount quickly if the military moves deeper into urban areas. Some 50,000 Palestinians are already staying in United Nations shelters, according to UNRWA, the UN refugee agency for Palestinians. - CBC NEWS',No

'‘Dirty minds’assigned to clean headlines!','Journalism is all about smart, clean headlines administered by dirty minds. Journalism is nothing without headlines. But they can be dangerously suggestive or out-and-out crude when invented by innocuous and clean-minded sub-editors. Strange but true that it takes a dirty mind to edit a clean newspaper. The very word ‘headline’ screams its meaning as the first and most important piece of the piece. Or to be precise it is the headstone of the story providing both the icing and the cherry-topping that holds it all up. All journalists should know this. Copy editors or sub-editors are entrusted with a myriad challenging and important tasks. These include checking facts, spelling and grammar, judging balance, taste and completeness and playing the role of style police. But they really have a chance to be bathed in the glow of their shining hour when conjuring up headlines. Essentially, it is the most creative part of the job. Certainly, writing great headlines is an art. You can churn out the most interesting article ever written, but if it doesn’t have a gripping headline to get people to read it, what’s the point? Or even the massive 60 point typeface that goes with it? Word play, alliteration, or take-offs on familiar phrases or clichés can create some attention-grabbing and often brilliantly amusing headlines. I have encountered some of the best and worst headlines in my long career as a scribbler in a diversity of journals both here and abroad. Some of them were horrendously banal. Others were simply hard-to-catch faux pas, which the creators themselves didn’t seem to latch on to even when they were pointed out by amused colleagues. There were some that smacked of both deliberate as well as unintentional double entendre. It just goes to underline the fact that journalism fortunately has its equal share of boring and consummately gifted filthy-minded ‘chuckleheads’ as well. This, in the estimation of many, is decidedly not a bad thing in the word-slinging profession. One indispensable qualification for a professional sub or copy editor is possession of a filthy mind. That is because the English language is rich in the possibilities of double entendres, with nouns that are also verbs, verbs that are also nouns, and countless idiomatic expressions that can take on scandalously salacious undertones. I know for sure, when I sit at the desk among the editors and hear the first subdued snort, or overt gleeful guffaw that a dirty mind has hooked another pungent one. And I am grateful for the sensibility that sniffs out lewdness or suggestive allusion in unlikely places. Take it from me then that editing is not for the pure at heart. Take for instance these painfully obvious and droll titles in my collection to apprise my journalism students of how not to write idiotic titles: ‘Pregnant girls are vulnerable to weight gain,’ or ‘Most earthquake damage is caused by shaking.’ There are other equally ridiculously brainless and laughable ones such as: ‘Jobs remain the best insurance against unemployment’ and ‘Homicide victims rarely talk to police.’ The Anchorage Times, in Alaska carried a review of a concert of Handel’s Messiah. The composition concentrates on the Passion and ends with the fiery ‘Hallelujah’ chorus. It seems obvious that the headline that ran with the story was not given the once-over by a dirty-minded sub-editor. The headline in question ran: ‘Messiah climaxes in chorus of hallelujahs!’ The Miami Herald once published this headline about a business takeover which was evidently conjured by a naughty mind: ‘Textron Inc. makes offer to screw company stockholders.’ It was a company that manufactures screws. The Chicago Daily News carried a similar one that read: ‘Petroleum jelly keeps idle tools rust-free.’ Many older journalists may also recall the famed Evening Sun headline on home canning and preserving, ‘You can put pickles up yourself.’ And such classics, whether intentional or accidental, are not confined to headline type, either. Several have been unearthed in the body copy as well. For instance, the Aberdeen Outrage was a military sex scandal in 1996 at Aberdeen Proving Ground, a United States Army base in Maryland, USA. The Army brought charges against 12 commissioned and non-commissioned male officers for sexual assault on female trainees under their command. The lead read: ‘The impact of the scandal has stretched from Aberdeen’s privates to its top officer.’ And this lead sentence about an angler aboard a fishing trawler: “Aboard the ‘Becky D,’ angler Ren Bowman grins with delight as his rod throbs with the energy of a large rockfish.” The moral of the story: Never use rod and throb in the same sentence. Some chauvinist male journos claim that a woman’s mind is cleaner than a man’s. That is because she changes it more often, they joke. But seriously speaking, the majority of them do possess untainted minds when compared with the mucky minds of their male peers. This is the main reason why innocent women sub-editors’ headlines are checked twice over for double meaning phrases and figures of speech that may be considered too risqué for publication. Another typical example which became part of Singaporean journalistic legend was a headline regarding a robbery. It was written by an innocent young woman Chinese sub-editor who never realised what the chuckles and chortles were all about. Her headline: ‘Ring lost in snatch.’ As a visiting lecturer in English journalism in a Hong Kong university I observed that the students appeared quite tickled whenever I referred to the subject of double entendre. Following one such lecture amid frequent giggles and titters a young female student held up her hand. Blushing like a rose she queried: “With all due respect to you sir, could you please tell us whether you are in the same dirty-minded category of male editors?” I fired back from the hip: “Who me? No not really. I wouldn’t call it that. It’s more a sexy imagination!” gdgasross@gmail.com ',No
'Brats unbound on the GROCERYKIDDY-GO-ROUND','Grocery shopping is not everyone\'s cup of tea. But when such expeditions include the kids, they become missions that most parents undertake with utter trepidation. But then it is an inescapable reality that every family has to experience. But first set the tone for your trip. Discuss what type of behaviour you expect from your children before shopping, and praise them when they demonstrate good behaviour. Also listen to advice of experts, who are obviously parents with large broods. Their initial advice is never to shop when you or the kids are hungry or tired. A fed kid is usually a happy one. Taking a toddler to the store at naptime is only asking for mayhem! It is rite of passage, called the \'supermarket shakedown\' which indeed shakes your maternal or paternal resolve to the very limit. But there are innovative diversionary tactics to avoid demands and tantrums. But when childish blackmail and push come to shove be firm. Don\'t capitulate. Just stick to your guns and emphatically say \'No!\' A list and a plan  A child with a grocery cart   Even during a serious standoff never relent and give in to infantile dictatorial demands for chips, cheese- bits or chocolate-coated cereals. There is sure to be the inevitable tantrums, screams, and foot-stomping. Many parents overwhelmed by such outbursts simply melt down while others with stronger resolve stick to their guns. Shopping lists and time are of the essence! Don\'t step into the grocery store without a list and a plan. And try not to dawdle at too many aisles. Frequent stops lead to boredom and frustration for kids, so keep moving as reasonably fast as you can. Some smart parents consider their time at the market with their children as a teaching opportunity. Toddlers may enjoy a book of grocery store foods they can compare with the items on display. They ask them about the colours of oranges, grapes, bananas and apples. What letters do these items start with is a capital educational idea. They have them count the number of lemons or tomatoes you want placed in the bag. They make them practice saying \'please\' and \'thank you\' when served by a shop assistant. I tell all kids in my charge like most crimes you can commit elsewhere, there are other public crimes that are not punishable by fine or jail time. But it doesn\'t mean they shouldn\'t be. Here are our biggest crimes committed by fellow grocery shoppers. Particularly in countries such as America there are reserved parking spaces for the differently-abled as well as for mother and child spaces. So I flip my lid when I see a lumbering great 12 or 14 year old exiting from a car parked in a mother and child space. I think that is a grocery store crime that calls for firm punitive action. A great idea Teach your child about safety and consideration for others. Impress on them that manoeuvring a grocery cart should be like driving a car. Warn them that their driving licence will be revoked if they resort to reckless steering. Advise them about the safety rules and to slow down at blind corners. Make them aware that they should stop at the end of the aisle and look both ways before proceeding. Counsel them to watch out for wayward kids and adults and be able to stop at a moment\'s notice. And always drive your cart down the left side of the aisle, in a Sri Lankan supermarket - the opposite applies in America. Tell them that if they don\'t keep their eyes peeled on the aisle there might probably be involved in a serious crash. A friend of mine conjured up a plastic card for his twin 7-year-olds saying they were grocery cart driving licences. The way some kids push their trolleys around with reckless abandon prompts me to suggest that it would be a great idea for big chains to hire grocery store traffic cops. I always read out the riot act to the kids before sallying forth on a grocery mission. It goes like this: \"Now here are the rules guys: Do not ask me for anything. I will decide on what treats you get because I know your preferences. Do not poke at the papaws just to see if your finger goes through them. And if it does happen accidentally don\'t lick your fingers. Simply have the fruit weighed and put it in our cart. Fun memories \"Do not test the laws of physics and try to take out the bottom can in the pyramid shaped display of instant soups or whatever other product. Do not play catch with oranges in the produce section. And no Grand Prix racing stuff down the aisles in separate carts. Understood?\" They all nod their heads in acquiescence and follow in Pied Piper fashion. Even if you manage to divert the kids\' attention and dodge the sugary treats without them noticing you will have to make the final stop at the checkout.This is where the devilish marketers really get you and the brats. Focusing on human nature and impulse buying they load the racks with temptingly displayed sinful confectionery that both sweet-toothed rapscallions and parents find totally irresistible. Now I must say that the toddler seats in our local supermarket carts are hardly baby-proof. They are decidedly downright dangerous. The little ones I have placed in them are far more precocious than any trolley designer could bargain for. Time and again I have caught a toddler playing Houdini and manoeuvring his little body out of his seat in an attempt to stand up. I am amazed that the little bounder and others of his contortionist ilk have made it to their second birthdays without suffering brain damaging head injuries. And always ask the kids to keep their observations to themselves and voice them in the car after the shopping is done. I had to shush my little grandson Kingsley when he was around four at checkout counter. He looked into the shopping trolley of a bald-as billiard- ball old coot directly in front of us. He turned to me with twinkling eyes and muttered in a loud whisper: \"What the heck is he buying shampoo for? He\'s bald!\" The lessons your child will learn while shopping with you might just turn into fun memories you will both look back on nostalgically one day. So you see, shopping with kids can be done fairly serenely. All it takes is a little planning, determination, and resolve. Okay, okay I concede that it takes perhaps nerves of steel as well! gdgasross@gmail.com ',No
'Average life expectancy of Sri Lankans up','The average life expectancy of Sri Lankans has gone up due to the rapid development of the health sector and the overall development of the country.

'NSB DiviSurakum pension scheme launched','The National Savings Bank (NSB) launched the NSB DiviSurakum pension scheme yesterday in Colombo, with the aim of catering to the needs of providing the citizens of the country with the security of a pension, whether the recipient is a resident or non-resident Sri Lankan. With a customer base of a little more than half of the country’s population, the NSB Scheme would help provide the initiator from the age of 35 up to 55 to either deposit a on a monthly basis or either by pitching in a lump sum in order to fully benefit from this plan.

'Bangladesh says 115 missing after ferry capsizes','BANGLADESH: Around 115 people were still missing Monday hours after a jam-packed ferry carrying around 250 passengers sank in the middle of a river in central Bangladesh, killing at least three and injuring dozens, officials said. \"115 ill-fated passengers\' relatives have so far lodged complaints to authorities, urging recovery of bodies,\" Kaniz Fatema, assistant superintendent of Police in Munshiganj district, some 27 km away from capital Dhaka, told Xinhua via mobile phone. She said 120 people, who survived by swimming, were rescued shortly after the ferry capsized in high winds and rain on the Padma\'s Maowa-Kewrakandi river route. She said rescuers have been facing severe difficulties due to high waves and strong winds in their search for missing people. Fatema said a heavy rescue vessel Rustom has been called in to boost local efforts to salvage the double-decker ferry which capsized in Padma, one of the three rivers that form the Ganges Delta. \"Hope divers could start operation to trace and salvage the sunken ferry shortly after the arrival of the rescue vessel which is on way to the accident site.\" Senior Fire Brigade official Nurul Alam Dulal said the waves are as high as 3-4 metres, while the location of the sunken ferry is quite far from the shore. He said the navy, coast guard and fire service divers have already joined the rescue operation but the inclement weather made it almost impossible for them to search in waters. More than 10 hours after the ferry capsized, according to the officials, divers fighting strong currents and winds were unable to search in waters to trace it. \"We\'re keenly awaiting the arrival of a heavy rescue vessel. Braving high waves and strong winds, we went to the probable accident site but could not stay there for a moment as the small engine boat carried us failed to anchor,\" Dulal said. - XINHUA ',No
'Man dies in trap gun misfire','A 46-year-old man died when his trap gun fired accidentally at a chena near his house recently. The victim, Saluwadana Banda, a resident of Pamunuwatanna, Hunnasgiriya, usually sets the trap gun to kill wild animals. On the day of the incident, he had gone to the Chena in his village faced the mishap. His son, due to the father\'s long absence, had gone to the Chena looking for him on the following day.

'House takes up Private Member’s motions for debate','Deputy Speaker Chandima Weerakkody presided when Parliament met at 1.30 pm yesterday. After the presentation of papers and oral questions, the House took up the Private Members motions moved by UNP MPs Ravi Karunanayake, Buddhika Pathirana, Ajith P. Perera and UPFA MP A.H.M. Azwer for debate. Ravi Karunanayake (UNP): I present my private member\'s motion, proposing to create a position termed \'Special Prosecutor\', to ensure that the government service is free from political interferences. A position named \'Special Prosecutor\', that directly reports to this Parliament should be created to institute prosecutions, as soon as Independent Commissions, Committees on Public Accounts and Committees on Public Enterprises report cases of misuse, corruption or inefficiency, which adversely affect the efficiency of the institutions. With the burial of the 17th Amendment to the constitution, the first to suffer was the former Chief Justice, who approved it. Independent commissions should be activated. I hope my motion will receive the support of all members in order to create a better government service. Ajith Mannapperuma (UNP): I second the motion. The next COPE report will be presented to the House in the coming months. However I would like to know what actions have been taken with regard to the findings of the previous COPE report? The COPE report suggested many valuable recommendations, but nothing has been implemented so far. This is because the law is not enforced properly. People have no faith on law enforcement authorities. Lakshman Kiriella (UNP): The motion refers to independent commissions. Most of all, the independence of the judiciary is important. Recently, Minister Hakeem stated that justice had not been done for the victims of the incidents in Beruwala and Aluthgama. The Muslims were deprived of justice due to the Muslim Congress, because the SLMC voted in favour of the 17th Amendment. Not only the Muslim community but also all communities in the country have suffered due to the action of the SLMC. Deputy Chairman of Committees Chandrakumar Murugesu takes the chair K. Velayudhan (UNP): I feel honoured to have entered Parliament representing the people of the Badulla District. I take this opportunity to express my best wishes to ex-MP Hareem, who is contesting the Uva Provincial Council. I propose to use this opportunity to bring out the common problems of the people in the Badulla region and the plantation community. I will work with devotion on behalf of the masses. I thank the Party leadership for having faith in me. Prof. Rajiva Wijesinha (UPFA): I congratulate the newly appointed MP who spoke just before me. We need to create an environment of pluralism. The Parliamentary Council does not function as the Opposition has boycotted it. If the Opposition had named its members to the Parliamentary Council, it could have functioned smoothly. Therefore, the Opposition has failed in its duties towards the people. Ajith P. Perera (UNP): Under the 18th Amendment of the constitution, the President can appoint a person he wishes to the position of Attorney General. Both the Attorney General\'s Department and Legal Draftsman\'s Department are under the power of the President. A group of UNPers including myself came under attack in Hambantota recently, when we visited the area. The file regarding this incident had been sent to the Attorney General\'s Department months ago, but we have not received any intimation whatsoever in this matter as yet. This delay is said to be due to the heavy load of work in the department. Action should be taken to solve this matter without delay. Justice Minister Rauf Hakeem: I extend my congratulations to MP K. Velayudhan who took oaths today in Parliament, representing the Badulla District. MP Ravi Karunanayake today spoke outside the topic, although it was he who moved the motion. I appreciate his suggestion to appoint a special prosecutor. I have been twice the Chairman of the COPE. Volumes of reports on the findings of the COPE have been presented to this House. But they have not been pursued successfully and to the end. The COPE has revealed the biggest frauds committed in the country and the Attorney General could have taken action to file cases against the suspects concerned. However some fled from the country on presentation of the report, but recently in one case, the suspect had been arrested. The Attorney General should consider these reports with concern. We have to appoint a special officer at the Attorney General’s Department to deal with maters and documents which are presented in Parliament. Parliament is the ‘watch dog’ of public finance and the Speaker should also consider this matter equally seriously. Ravi Karunanayake (UNP): The COPE has been inquiring for years into the public finance spending of the people of the country. However it appears that the officers who committed frauds have been granted promotions and that no fruitful action has been taken. In these circumstances, the money spent on COPE is an utter waste. Deputy Chairman of Committees Chandra Kumar Murugesu: The private member’s motion to be moved by Buddhika Pathirana now. Buddhika Pathirana (UNP): I move that this Parliament resolves that laws be formulated for the registration of pets such as dogs and cats in local government authorities, and that laws be formulated to the effect that the sale of these young animals should be done only at authorized centers. There are laws and regulations in this country that dogs reared as pets have to be registered at the local government body. But it is not implemented properly. Some of these dogs have become a menace to the people and they even spread diseases such as rabies. Nowadays, it can be seen that non-communicable diseases are spreading faster than communicable diseases, whereas it should have been the other way around. Some of these non-communicable diseases are found to be spread by pets such as dogs, cats, parrots, certain rats species, pigeons and so on. If at present, laws have been formulated only relating to dogs, laws have now to be formulated and implemented with regard to the other animals as well. This would also be an additional income earner for local government authorities. Ajith Mannapperuma (UNP): I second this motion. This matter that MP Buddhika Pathirana brings about is becoming worse day by day as the plots of lands in which houses have been built, are growing smaller due to the expansion of the population and the non available of house build-able lands. Most people now live in 10 perch or even six perch blocks of lands due to the matter which was stated. In the year 1938 there was an Act on registration of dogs but we don’t have such Act now in force. Ajith P. Perera (UNP): Now it is found that certain people rear foreign rats as pets. Dogs, cats, rats, parrots, pigeons, lovebirds, mynahs all carry various diseases. It is sad that animals kept for display to the public in the Dehiwala zoo too, are not treated properly as they should. I request that the government take action to impose laws to prevent harm being done to animals and in turn, prevent harm being done by animals to man. Justice Minister Rauf Hakeem: I thank MP Buddhika Pathirana for bringing in a timely motion. It also gave me some education on laws which existed in the past periods. This motion suggests to strengthen the welfare of animals, provide protection to them and also prevent harm happening to people by animals. In Sri Lanka which is a predominantly Buddhist country, it must be said that kindness to animals is considered to be of great importance. MP Pathirana spoke of the aspect of selling pets to the people and I too firmly believe that there should be legislation to register pet shops. Deputy Minister of Livestock and Rural Community Development H.R.Mithrapala: This Act has been already formulated. It is in the Legal Draftsman’s Department. I do not know if the MP presented this motion to the House being fully aware of the move of this government. However, the matters of animals are covered fully under the proposed regulations. I state that the ‘Animals Welfare Act’ will be brought and presented to Parliament soon. MP Buddhika also spoke of beggars in the country but there cannot be any beggars whatsoever. According to the UN, persons who gets an income of lesser than one dollar, are classified as poor. This government has taken action and pays Rs. 3,000 for such people. So there cannot be beggars in this country. If there are any beggars they are fakes and liars. A.L.M. Athaullah: When the Act is brought before Parliament, we will discuss on the amendments. Actually there are various issues in this regard as there are animals and birds which are unknown to us in the market for sale. These should be looked into carefully. Buddhika Pathirana (UNP): I moved this motion to be entered into the Order Book in the year 2010. We are currently in the year 2014. Four years have lapsed. Deputy Chairman of Committees Murugesu Chandrakumar: Now the private members’ motion by MP A.H.M. Azwer may be moved. A.H.M. Azwer (UPFA): This Parliament resolves that the traditional industries which have been dwindling in the Ampara District such as handlooms, pottery etc should be developed. Kamala Ranatunga (UPFA): I am pleased to second the motion presented by MP Azwer. It is a timely and important motion. I can recollect that the former Prime Minister the late Mrs. Sirimavo Bandaranaike wore only locally made and manufactured sarees on all occasions. Many ladies in the country followed the example which had been provided by her at that time. It was a great encouragement to our handloom producers who had at one time been confronted with the problem of selling their products. However, with the introduction of the open economy, traditional industries got badly and severely affected. Local producers were compelled to compete with imported goods and very often they were not successful due to various reasons. I suggest that not only in Ampara, the traditional industries should be revived all over the country. Deputy Speaker Chandima Weerakkoday takes the chair Ajith P. Perera (UNP): I admire and respect the motion presented in the House today. My mother was a specialist in the handloom industry and while I was in grade six, I also studied the subject of handloom industry at Horana Thaxila Vidyalaya. During those days government schools had been provided with facilities to study handloom as a practical subject. With the open economy introduced a few years ago, the handloom industry was affected to a certain degree. However, in the modern era, there is a fairly good demand for local handloom products. We need to identify this market and take steps to promote it further. Handloom products are now sold at higher prices among the upper and upper-middle classes due to their eccentric and uncommon designs and attractiveness. Justice Minister Rauf Hakeem: As I am the only Minister who happens to be present in the House, the responsibility of replying the motion has been put onto my shoulders. The government has taken great efforts to promote the traditional industries in this country. Once I visited the office of Minister Basil Rajapaksa and I saw for myself that it was filled with various kind of products based on our traditional industries. His enthusiasm to promote these industries could be understood just by entering his office. In my view, the whole issue of developing traditional industries depends on protective tariff carriers. This kind of protective tarriffs are in operation in many other countries. We need to introduce new designs for the local handloom and clothing industry. For that, we need to pay more attention on master weavers. A programme to provide loans for those involved in traditional industries have been proposed for implementation by the government. A H M Azwer (UPFA): I thank all Members who spoke for and against the motion and for their words of encouragement. Ajith P. Perera (UNP): I present my private member motion to introduce summary procedure for compensation cases related to motor vehicles. The code of civil procedure should be amended so that a summary procedure would be introduced for compensation cases related to motor vehicles since heirs and dependents of persons deceased due to accidents related to motor vehicles and those who have been injured due to such accidents become extremely helpless by having to participate in very difficult and prolonged litigation cases. Deputy Chairman of Committees Chandrakumar Murugesu takes the chair Buddhika Pathirana (UNP): I second the motion. Justice Minister Rauf Hakeem: As the Justice Minister I would like to comment on the motion. The reason for bringing in this motion as MP Ajith Perera says is that the heirs and dependents become helpless due to prolonged litigation. We need to study more on how useful and suitable it is to use summary produce for compensation cases related to motor vehicles. The code of Civil Procedure and other related documents should be scrutinized for this purpose. We will do so, and we will look into the possibility of implementing this proposal. However, I must also note that some amendments to the civil procedure code have already been finalized and would be presented to the House shortly. As amendments to the code of civil procedure could take time I cannot assure that the proposed amendment will be made promptly. However, it is an important proposal that would give some relief to accident victims. We will look into it. I request the Bar Association to cooperate with us in this regard and other matters. Ajith P. Perera (UNP): The summary procedure is being followed even in divorce cases. Therefore it is not impossible to introduce it to compensation cases related to motor vehicles. The House was adjourned until 1.00 pm on August 19. Deputy Speaker warns MP Buddhika SANDASEN MARASINGHE and DISNA MUDALIGE Deputy Speaker Chandima Weerakkody yesterday warned UNP MP Buddhika Pathirana to be responsible when speaking in Parliament, when Water Supply and Drainage Minister Dinesh Gunawardena pointed out that the MP attempted to mislead people by spreading baseless statements on food and drinking water. Minister Dinesh Gunawardena said that the Water Board assures that the water supplied to the people in Kandy is tested at standard laboratories and is safe for consuming. He stated that MP Pathirana for the second time, raised a question on the safety of water without any evidence, to create a fear psychosis among the people. Minister Gunawardena further stated that this should not be the role of a member and that he has to act with a sense of responsibility. The minister made these observations in response to a question raised by UNP MP Buddhika Pathirana in Parliament yesterday during question time. New MP sworn in SANDASEN MARASINGHE and DISNA MUDALIGE K. Velayudhan was sworn in as UNP Badulla District MP in Parliament yesterday. He fills the vacancy created by the resignation of Harin Fernando, to contest the Uva Provincial Council elections. He took oaths at the commencement of sittings. Deputy Speaker Chandima Weerakkody was presiding in the House. Members of both sides congratulated him by thumping on their desks. Animal Welfare Act in Parliament soon SANDASEN MARASINGHE and DISNA MUDALIGE Livestock and Rural Community Development Deputy Minister H. R. Mithrapala said that everything is set to move the ‘Animals Welfare Act’ soon in Parliament. He said that the Bill is in the Legal Draftsman’s Department and that it is in the last stage before being presented before Parliament. He said that it contains provisions on saving animals and pets to provide welfare to animals as well as to protect the people from animals reared by others. He also said that this Act had to be formulated as a large variety of animals are reared as household pets and therefore legislation is needed. He made these observations in Parliament during the speech he made joining the private members’ motion moved by UNP MP Buddhika Pathirana. ',No
'Iranian aircraft with over 40 on board crashes','An Iranian plane with over 40 people on board fatally crashed near the capital, Tehran. The incident took place last morning north of the International Mehrabad Airport, IRNA reported. The Antonov An-140 aircraft belonged to a domestic airlines and was scheduled to travel from Tehran to the northeastern city of Tabas when the incident occurred. A senior aviation official said 48 people, among them several children, were on board the plane when it smashed into the ground. All passengers and crew members are feared dead. Initial reports blame an engine failure for the disaster. Iran has suffered a series of airplane crashes, blamed on its aging aircraft and poor maintenance. The latest major crash occurred in January 2011, when a passenger plane broke into pieces on impact while trying an emergency landing in a snowstorm in northwestern Iran, killing 77 people. In July 2009, a Russian-made jetliner crashed in Iran’s northwest shortly after taking off from the capital, killing all the 168 people on board.

'[APPRECIATION - (12-08-2014)]','Lt. Gen Denzil Kobbekaduwa: Humanitarian approach won him UNHRC plaudits “When you are inspired by some extraordinary project, all your thoughts break their bounds. Your mind transcends limitations” - Patanjali. Lt. Gen. Denzil Kobbekaduwa\'s life was snatched away on August 8, 1992 leaving ever grateful millions of Sri Lanka in tears. He was a gentle soldier who led his team tactfully and bravely infusing confidence and inspiration to all who came into contact with him. The strategy and tactics he employed in the battlefield are legendary in that maximum results were achieved with the minimum use of resources causing least dislocation to civilians. The recapture of the Elephant Pass in 1991, the clearance of the Eastern Province and Adampan Operation were some of the more significant and memorable battlefield achievements of this military leader. One important quality of this great soldier was his inborn sense of justice and fair play. He won the hearts and minds of civilians as well as the fighting cardre. He lead from the front and was able to convince his forces that it was their own war and the civilians, that it was much better to live in a free society than under the terrorists. His humanitarian approach towards the civilians won him plaudits from UNHCR. Even after he was heavily wounded, Lt. General Kobbekaduwa at the site of the blast told the others, “I am alright. See what can be done for the others”, underlining his human kindness. The legend of Denzil Kobbekadwa will be a beacon forever for generations of Sri Lankan soldiers who are the protectors of the nation and the land of Sri Lanka. The following quote from \'The Lost Art of War\' remind us of the peerless calibre of this gentle giant. “Commanders must be just. If they are not just they will lack dignity. Commanders must be human. If they are not human, their forces will not be effective. Commanders must have integrity. Without integrity they have no power.” RANJITH SOYSA - email S.D. Bandaranayake: Architect of Bandaranayake Vidyalaya The passing away on June 3, 2014 removed from our midst a senior citizen, son of the soil of Yakkala, Gampaha, veteran SLFP politician and ex- Member of Parliament for Gampaha on six occasions. His demise occurred in his 98th year, having spent a very fruitful life. His longevity was due to his cheerful disposition and adherence to strict health habits. Born to wealth and influence, he hailed from the reputed well-to-do Bandaranayake \'den\' that came into prominence from the Sitawaka Kingdom. Their ancestors had migrated to Sri Lanka to perform rituals at the Pattini Devala at Navagamuwa, Hanwella in Avissawella in the Kelani Valley area. Those kovil–devale priests first came to be known as Kalu-Kapuge families. During the Portuguese period when they held high positions, they adopted the Portuguese surname of Dias preceded by the honorific name Don added to the surname Dias. During the Dutch and the British colonial regimes when they came into very high positions as local chieftains namely, Mudaliyars, they took the more recognized surname of Bandaranayake. So they came to be known as \'Dias Bandaranayakes\'. The family of that den Sir Don Solomon Dias Bandaranaike Maha Mudaliyar, got used to writing his surname as Bandaranaike, rather with an English accent. That happened during the early period of the British. Samuel Dias Bandaranayake\'s father himself was also such a local chieftain. He was Mudaliyar Charles Peter Dias Bandaranayake, S.D. Bandaranayake\'s mother too, belonged to a respectable wealthy family. S.D. (Sam) first received his primary or preliminary education at a famous Pirivena in Matara. There he was educated in a Buddhist atmosphere. He learnt with enthusiasm, Sinhala language, literature, the Dhamma, Buddhism, history, Sinhala habitual culture and heritage. For his secondary education in the English medium, he was admitted to S. Thomas\'s College, Mount Lavinia. At the time when Sam entered St. Thomas\' College the educational main objective was \'Good English, better English\'. He got proficient in that language so much so that he built up the real method of pronunciation with the correct accent with the result that till he breathed his last, SD was fluent in English. True to the opinion of that epoch in keeping with the English grammar school notion “No play and all work makes Jack a dull boy”, Sam the young student with the youthful exuberance actively participated in sports and athletics. Later in life his forte was volleyball. In the true spirit of active and brisk sportsman, his courageous character was moulded to face both victory and defeat in any endeavour or cause. After the completion of his secondary education at St. Thomas\', he proceeded to India and studied scientific agriculture. On his return to the motherland, he took to planting in his father\'s estates. During the 2nd World War, the government established the Agricultural Corps. Sam joined the organization that was under the control of the Minister of Agriculture D.S. Senanayake, subsequently the first Prime Minister of independent Sri Lanka. S.D. served the Agriculture Corps as a high-ranking officer and worked as an assistant in the dry zone of the North Central Province. In that capacity he served in the Anuradhapura and Polonnaruwa Districts. By then he was conversant with Marxism–Leninism that took root in our soil after the founding of the Lanka Sama Samaja Party and the Communist Party. Being a communist at heart, he endeavoured to ameliorate the living conditions of the rank and file of the corps. He voiced opinion for nutritious meals, holiday leave, and better emoluments and service terms for employees. The socialist ways and ideology became an eye-sore to the higher echelons of authority. They were an anathema to them. Then he resigned from the Corps. S.W.R.D. Bandaranaike then Minister of Health and Local Government, left his erstwhile party the UNP and formed a new party the SLFP in 1954 with his second-in-command H. Sri Nissanka, Q C the eminent criminal lawyer. S.D. too joined the Sri Lanka Freedom Party as a pioneer member. Other Members of Parliament at that time who wanted to follow in the footsteps of their leader S.W.R.D. Bandaranaike with a national feeling, were D.A. Rajapaksa ‘the Lion of Ruhuna’ the bold, courageous father of our President Mahinda Rajapaksa, A.P. Jayasuriya, lawyer, Jayaweera Kuruppu and D.S. Gunasekera. Although S.D. was with leanings towards communism he was determined to come forward as a genuine fighter to give the proper, rightful, justifiable status for the Sinhala language as the official language, Buddhism its due place and the implementation of the Buddhasasana Commission Report improvement and development of the Ayurveda system of medicine, education in the mother tongue for students – Sinhala or Tamil. Soon afterwards like the great Roman Consul Lucius Quintus Cincinnatus who came out from his farm where he was living in retirement at the appointed time to assume Commander of the Army for a national cause to repel belligerent invading rebels, SD appeared as the pioneer SLFP organizer for the Gampaha electorate. He took the initiative in organizing the new radical, democratic, socialist party in Gampaha for which he obtained the readily available support of Ayurvedic Dr. M.C. Chandrasena of Gampaha, Jaya Pathirana lawyer, Advocate of Kurunegala (later Justice), Dr Jayapathirana, Justice of the Supreme Court and his elder brother Ariya Pathirana Dental Surgeon, Kurunegala also supported by swabhasha Teachers, ayurvedic physicians and all other progressive forces hitherto deprived of their due privileges by the exiting UNP regime. Since then it was a case of veni, vidi, vici – I came, I saw, I conquered for SD as he was popularly and affectionately known among his political supporters and acquaintances. To those who were near and dear to him, his kith and kin, he was simply Sam. He was returned as the SLFP MP for Gampaha at the parliamentary elections of 1952, 1956, 1960 both March and July elections, 1965 and election 1977. However, he was not without defeat. Once in his political careers he tasted defeat. That was at the 1970 elections. He made a great political blunder in that fateful year of 1970 which he contested as a candidate of the Communist Party China wing. That was his first debacle. He decried and held up in ridicule the despotic governments since independence. He coined the term \'Bonapartism\' of the UNP. He called its leaders Bonaparties and appealed to the masses to keep them at bay. A genuine lover of China and the industrious brilliant Chinese nationals, he moved intimately with the great Chinese National leader MaoTse-Tung. As a friend of China, he occasionally visited that vast, fast progressing prosperous country. To him all his supporters were comrades. Although he moved with royalty, he never lost the common touch. He moved freely even with the low state of society – drawers of water and hewers of wood. For the welfare of the Gampaha electorate, he did yeoman service. He may be justifiably called the \'Architect of Bandaranayake Vidyalaya\', Gampaha, the leading boys’ collegiate school in that district. Likewise, he saw to it that Ratnavali Balika Vidyalaya rose up to the present status. Both are equivalent to leading schools in Colombo. The Bandaranayake Vidyalaya, Gampaha, was set up during the British rule in 1918 named Government English School near the Medagama, Gampaha Buddhist Temple in close proximity to the Courts of Law and the then UC Park. With the introduction of free education by the first Minister of Education Dr. C.W.W. Kannangara it was classified as a Senior Secondary School, that is below the category of a Central School. However, soon after SD was elected as the MP for Gampaha he was determined to tremendously improve the school. He got a spacious and ‘Green Estate’ acquired to put up magnificent buildings for the college. The land was situated at Kasagahawatte, Yakkala Road, Gampaha. He put up many buildings and a vast playground for it and named the significant school as Bandaranayake Vidyalaya. It is also to his undying memory that he greatly improved several other schools in the electorate such as Alutgama, Yakkala Anura Vidyalaya, now Central College, Yakkala Chandrajothi Vidyalaya. Siddhartha Vidyalaya, Yasodhara Vidyalaya, Sri Bodhi Vidyalaya, Gothami Vidyalaya all in Gampaha. Rajasinghe Vidyalaya, Imbulgoda Madduma Bandara Maha Vidyalaya, Weliweriya Keppetipola Maha Vidyalaya, Miriswatte Rahula Vidyalaya in Belummahara and so on. At Yakkala he established the Hardware Corporation with Polish aid. It was financed by the Government of Poland. The CTB depot at Bendiyamulla, Gampaha was due to his sagacious planning. He was also a staunch supporter of the Wickramaracchi Ayurvedic Institute and hospital at Yakkala. SD lived a happy wedded life along with his wife Doreen. The couple was blessed with four children – two sons and two daughters. It is heartening to see his younger son Pandu, Deputy Minister following in his footsteps, reputed as an honest gentleman, SLFP politician. Of him it could be remarked that he could put to shame or surpass Dale Carnegie, the American author of the famous text \'How to win friends and influence people\', as far as his craft of sociability and the tactful ways of winning friends were concerned. He used to lavishly entertain his supporters and all his intimate colleagues and associates. If at all a visitor came to see him at meal times he saw to it that he too shared meals along with him. He never harboured any grudge with anybody even a foe or opponent. His services to Gampaha is unforgettable. Although SD is no more and his mortal remains have perished, his name will never fade from the memory of his near and dear loyal constituents. Such men are rarely born. To be precise, his great exemplary characteristic of life could stated thus: \'As a solid rock is not shaken by the wind, even so are the wise men unshaken in blame or praise – 81 stanza – Dhammapada. May he attain the Supreme Bliss of Nirvana! STANLEY E. ABEYNAYAKE , YAKKALA Neale De Alwis: Returned the unspent $350 to the government Neale de Alwis, MP and former Deputy Minister of Finance and Public Administration was a long standing member of the LSSP. He was my uncle as his father and my grandfather married two sisters. His family consisted of Earl (who was a former Municipal Commissioner), Stephanie Guruswamy who died recently at the age of 100 years, Dunstan de Alwis who was a former race horse trainer and Upatissa de Alwis who was a Director at Carson Cumberbatch and Company. Uncle Neale was the most popular uncle in our ‘de Alwis’ clan other than Uncle Clement, Mudliyar A.C. de Alwis. He was MP at Udugama and later MP for Baddegama until he lost the election in 1977 to his arch rival Wickrematilake better known in the village as Podiralahamy. Uncle Neale was a Planter by profession and the Chairman of the Planters’ Association in the South. He was greatly respected by the planting fraternity and was one of those few honourable politicians who was very forthright in what he said and did. He lived as a bachelor till the time that he passed away. It could be said that he was heart broken after his election defeat and more so because some relations whom he helped, betrayed the trust he had in them. He was honest and lived a very simple life. I recall the time when he was a Deputy Minister and went for a conference on one occasion, to the West. On his return, he brought back a balance of $350 of the $1,000 he had taken with him, which he returned to the government. This was revealed by him when I asked him about the gifts for us. He was the Deputy Minister when I happened to be Felix Dias Bandaranayake’s Security Officer. Uncle Neale was appointed to act for the Finance and Public Administration Minister when Felix Dias went out of the country and he demanded as Acting Minister, that I come with him to proceed to his electorate at Baddegama. He had his own way of handling issues in the electorate as almost all public servants and planters used to visit him and enjoy his hospitality. He was very methodical and neat and it was greatly displayed in his residence at Keembiya in the electorate. I had great respect for him as an honourable politician. I was there with him during his last days when he suffered a stroke and lived in his niece’s house at Rosmead Place. I clearly remember visiting him and ensuring that he was washed and kept clean, as he was helpless and his attendant had to help him. His Private Secretary was Siripala Alwis, who later retired as Assistant Commissioner Immigration. He helped many poor people to get employment. Recently a much respected and grateful person from the electorate met us with the fervent idea of publishing a book in his name but it appears that this book is not yet published. I believe in the saying – “The worst solitude is to be destitute of sincere friendship”, and that is what happened to him during his last years. May he Rest in Peace! F.N. DE ALWIS NUGEGODA T.B. Illangaratne: A committed and honest politician I came to know T.B. Illangaratne and his family when I was detailed by the Intelligence Division, recommended by my good friend and batch mate Tissa Satharasinghe, to work as the Additional Security Officer to him during the pre-1971 insurgency and post insurgency period. At first, I had my reservations about him as a true politician. Ultimately, I am glad that I had the opportunity of working with him or else I would have had a completely distorted view of him as a committed and honest politician. I did not know much about Illangaratne\'s family or his political beginnings and background until I commenced working with him. My frank assessment of him is that he was a simple humble politician who started as an old Anthonian, a clerk, a trade union leader, author of several books and ultimately one who reached the position of Trade Minister after a short stint as a Finance Minister too. His home was an open house with a very faithful, loyal and committed wife in Tamara. Both were ardent Buddhists who shared their values with their children and ensured that the children shared religious values, not only by going to the Temple on Poya days but also by practicing these values and being an excellent example to their children. Both husband and wife created a loving family and shared what they had with those have-nots and lesser beings whether related or otherwise. I admired T.B. Illangaratne for the high standard of honesty and integrity, simplicity, patience and forgiveness he possessed in great measure. He was valued during his position as minister despite mud slinging brought about by several of his colleagues, relations and opponents to tarnish his reputation. Many benefited because of his generosity and sadly some who benefited by way of high positions as Chairmen of corporations under his purview as Minister of Trade, betrayed his trust by fleecing the public and making dishonest deals, which was the ultimate cause for his losing the elections. I am aware of some of these cases personally. He was always ready to help the young politicians, one such person being the present President, Mahinda Rajapaksa, and not excluding Mervyn Silva by providing employment to youth in their electorates. T.B. Illangaratne was very knowledgeable, an avid reader, and one who was a real father-figure to young politicians. This country has forgotten the valuable contributions made by him in creating the EPF scheme, and nationalization of insurance companies. He in fact expanded the CWE, to drive the Indian trader who was the mastermind in the dry fish trade in Sri Lanka, with an able Chairman in R.I. Obeysekera. He was a man of tremendous patience. I recall one particular incident when he was nursing the Kolonnawa electorate and met the voters on a Sunday. A father came upto him and abused him in typical Sinhalese foul language after liquor for not giving his son employment, despite his four other children being provided employment. I was about to handle him when the minister cautioned me and said, “Nihal Stop”. Finally he asked the voter, “Have you finished?”. He thanked him and it ended there. Later, whilst travelling in the car he told me, “Nihal that is politics. We have to accept abuse.” He was full of wit too. As he was geared to go for a Cabinet meeting on a particular Wednesday, I found he was delaying. Hence I took the liberty of visiting the wash room. When I returned he was waiting for me in the verandah and I apologized. He said, “Don\'t worry, one fellow came with a knife to stab me. I told him, wait a minute my Security Officer is in the toilet.” After his defeat at the General Election of 1972 I visited his official residence but there was hardly anyone there. He appeared to be very disappointed not only because he lost the election but also as none of his friends and affluent supporters who had obtained important position in corporations, were there with him. He had failed to vacate the quarters to enable his successor to occupy, as the tenant refused to budge from his only house which he had built with a loan. He had to be conveyed by me the sad news that his very loyal Security Officer Tissa Satarasinghe had died in Teheran in a motor accident. T.B. Illangaratne had served this country with great passion and helped the needy. The following saying is very apt considering the service he displayed with great love and a contrite heart. “If I can in anyway contribute to the diversion or improvement of the country in which I live, I shall leave it when I am summoned out of it, with the secret satisfaction of finishing that I have not lived in vain” (Joseph Addison). Politicians today should try to emulate the humility, decency, patience and exemplary conduct he displayed with tremendous attachment to his immediate family, never neglecting responsibilities as a husband and father. F.N. DE ALWIS , NUGEGODA Austin Perera (Toughy): Lion-hearted Air Force Officer Austin Perera my grandfather, was born on October 6, 1932 and received his education at De La Salle College Mutwal. He gained popularity as a wrestler. In his school days he was the Under 10 Wrestling Champion in the all-island competitions and the Under 19 YMCA Wrestling Champion as well. After obtaining his Senior School Certificate he joined the Royal Ceylon Air Force (RCyAF) and served until his retirement in 1977. During his period of service in the Air Force he was awarded several medals and decorations including the Long Service and Good Conduct Medal. In the Air Force Seeya was popularly knows as ‘Toughy’ because of his bravery and courage. He was never scared of anybody or anything. On December 28, 1966 he married Malani Perera my grandmother and after 11 years of marriage they were blessed with a daughter whom they named Dushanthie, who became my mother. She married Jude Perera, a Commissioned Officer of the Sri Lanka Air Force and they were in turn blessed with two sons whom they named Thisura my brother and Sathira, myself. Seeya did everything to entertain me and my brother. When I was a little child he used to take me to the montessori and bring me back home. On the way, he used to teach me about various trees, birds and nursery rhymes which I can still remember. He was a great artist and a designer and taught me and my brother how to mix shades and produce different colours. He was a great ballroom dancer too. He always stood for justice and took care not to commit even the slightest of mistakes. He had the exceptional practice of doing everything at the correct time and also taught me to do things at the correct time. When I was in grade one, Seeya used to polish my shoes so that I could see my own face in it. Thanks to him I learnt to iron my uniform and polish my shoes. Being a good chef as well, he used to create various dishes and named them after himself. Every evening he used to tell us stories about Kings, demons, fairies and so on. We were thrilled to listen to his narrations. He told me something that still echoes in my ears. He said, “A beggar has to die one day and even the King has to die one day. So we have to do good to others and never hurt anyone\'s feelings. Everybody has to prepare for his last day”. As he said, he never got upset in his last days. He passed away on April 24, 2014 quite peacefully. In life he was a character like a lion. He was strong, smart and kept his word always. He always did everything according to the law. He never roared without a reason. Though he was called \'Toughy\', he was never tough to amma, achchi, mallie or me. He was a great person. He will always stay in my heart for ever. May his soul Rest in Peace ! SATHIRA PERERA , ROYAL COLLEGE, COLOMBO ',No
'Femme fatale!','French filmmaker Luc Besson has a couple of successful productions and scripts like \'Taken\' and \'The Transporter\' to his name. Now he can add \'Lucy\' to the list. Though the movie has a shaky plot it is an entertaining watch. The tale is based on a concept out of the most delirious possible extremes. Lucy is an American student in Taipei. She is tricked into delivering a suitcase to a hotel by her lowlife boyfriend. However the hotel seems to be swarming with murderous gangsters lead by a megalomaniac named Mr. Jang. A terrified Lucy is then captured and forced into working for them. They use her as a drug mule by sewing a bag of experimental narcotics into her stomach. When the bag is accidentally punctured, its contents enter her bloodstream. She gains powers which no other human can match enabling access to more than the normal 10 percent of her brain.  The latest to join Besson wants us to recognize that we too are animals, and that evolution is still a part of our lives and place in time. Thus the animal imagery and Morgan Freeman\'s Professor Norman\'s lectures are inserted into the story. The movie runs for around 90 minutes which seems ideal for a story of this nature because an overdose would have clearly spoiled it. It is amazing that though the film and action continues Besson also manages to unveil Lucy\'s character to the audience in such a short span. She is quickly established as a woman who does not shy away from a party night but is too timid to face danger till her power of revenge is roused. Though the story takes a route which sways between science fiction and super heroism, Besson also make us aware that this kind of tragedy can befall on any of us. From Nikita to Mathilda and Leeloo, Besson\'s super heroines have always teased apocalyptic potential. Scarlett Johansson is the latest to join the list.  Professor Norman and Lucy  Johansson is excellent in her performance. Though this is a much more tamed down version of the Black Widow she still never ceases to amaze the audience. Her performance is the key to the film\'s success and no other actress could have possibly carried off the role as well as she does. She is fearless in her act and reminds us just what it took her to overshadow even Capitan America in the popular film series. One of the drawbacks of the movie is that apart from the car chase there is only a limited amount of action scenes in \'Lucy\'. It is visually coherent because Lucy talks to Jang and his goons through telekinetic powers and mundane weapons. Another minus point is when Lucy shoots a taxi driver for being uncooperative and kills a hospital patient so the surgeon can fix her up instead. This throws us off our course because we are not sure whether to regard Lucy as the heroine of the movie or not. It does not help the bad taste it generates even though Besson indicates that the taxi driver survived and that the patient was about to die anyway. Amr Waked plays a somewhat minor role in Johansson\'s shadow as a cop who is fascinated by the femme fatale. However his relationship with Lucy is awkward even though they share a lip lock in the midst of the action. The director could have made more use of an actress of Johansson\'s potentials because she has proved her abilities to tackle stunts. Include more action scenes like those in the Angelina Jolie starrer \'Salt\' and Johansson would have given Jolie a run for her money! Johansson\'s transition from the smiling and sassy young woman to weepy and timid student and later to the fearless vixen is convincing. We are rooted to her plight when she begs for her life. Later more details about her are revealed when she engages in a telephone conversation with her mother. This is a moment of heartbreaking vulnerability till Lucy sheds her emotions to take on the task of claiming revenge on her enemies. The movie with its blood splattering images and sexual content is clearly not meant for children. \'Lucy\' is screening at Majestic Cineplex\'s Superior and Empire Arcade, Independence Square\'s Gold cinemas. ',No
'TALE OF TWO CITIES RETURNING TO THE TOURIST TRAIL','In every age ‘the good old days’ was a myth. No one ever thought they were good at the time, for every age has consisted of crises that seemed intolerable to the people who lived through them. - Brooks Atkinson-Once around the Sun (1951) It was recently reported in the media that Jaffna and Trincomalee, two cities in Sri Lanka which hardly saw any tourist arrivals or for that matter many visitors neither local nor foreign during the nearly three decade long conflict are now witnessing a sizeable influx of tourist arrivals. These two Sri Lankan cities at the heart of the conflict are creeping back onto the tourist trail from which they were blocked until peace came to Sri Lanka five years ago. The island that sparked the word “serendipity”, describing happy discoveries made accidentally and derived from Serendip, an ancient name for Sri Lanka (Ceylon in colonial times) is again tranquil. Slightly smaller than Tasmania but with a population as big as Australia’s, teardrop-shaped Sri Lanka has an elaborate network of mostly narrow paved roads winding from the coast to its tea-growing hinterland. The end of the conflict has been a blessing because neither side targeted tourists and the conflict was almost totally confined to areas with little tourist infrastructure. Thus, the important tourism industry warded off damaging blows. Holidaymakers kept coming, enticed by bargain prices, high-quality resorts, cut-price shopping, good beaches and attractions ranging from ancient cities to wildlife parks with large populations of elephants and other animals.  Nilavweli beach, Trincomalee Central to the conflict were the north’s main city, Jaffna, and its mainly Tamil surroundings, along with the northeast’s hub, Trincomalee. Entrepreneurs in both cities see economic potential and now appear to want slices of the tourism cake. Both cities have many small hotels, with large resort-style properties. Already, Jaffna and Trincomalee are seeing an influx of tourists. Jaffna, closest to India and a major centre of Hindu culture, bills itself as Sri Lanka’s “final frontier” while Trincomalee boasts of a rich heritage and some of Asia’s most alluring white-sand beaches. Best beaches, Nilaveli and Uppaveli Old Morris and Austin cars are everywhere. More modern vehicles are increasingly seen but, old British cars became workhorses during sieges out of which many operate as taxis and others as private cars. There is plenty of fish and fruit at Jaffna’s municipal market. People are friendly. Even uniformed soldiers are unarmed. At the Rosarian Sisters’ Ashram Catholic nuns use grapes to make wine. But they don’t drink it themselves. The Church of Christ is a bombed-out shell. Downtown, the historic Jaffna Library, once again in operation, is one of many restored buildings. The Clock Tower, a formerly derelict landmark, has been painted and is again keeping time. Colourfully decorated Hindu temples dot Jaffna. Narrow causeways connect Jaffna Peninsula to the islands of Kayts with a busy fishing harbour and splendid beaches at Punkudutivu and Karaitivu. More distant and reached by ferry is a popular backpacker destination, sparsely vegetated Delft – a windswept isle of defiant grasses and sandy beaches boasting an old Dutch fort. Back on the mainland a bizarre grove of palm trees: just trunks, with treetops blasted away by artillery serve as reminders of troubled times. Trincomalee is renowned for diving amid sunken ships and aircraft. Its other dive sites are similarly rich in tropical fish and colourful coral, including gathering places of moray eels and manta rays. Diving locations are close to Trincomalee’s two best beaches, Nilaveli and Uppaveli. From Nilaveli it’s a 3km boat ride to Pigeon Island, most of which is Pigeon Island National Park. Upscale Pigeon Island Beach Resort has a beach ideal for lazing, with an adjoining Beach Bar spilling onto the sand. Diving, snorkelling and swimming are on tap as are excursions to nearby hot springs. There are several Hindu temples, the most visited of which is Kali Kovil from where it’s not far to blue-hued and 162-year-old St Mary’s (Catholic) Cathedral. The cathedral is a serene prelude to the boisterous local fish market, a place of high-decible haggling at the edge of what’s claimed to be the world’s second-biggest natural harbour. Top of Trincomalee’s list of attractions is thick-walled Fort Frederick. Built by the Portuguese in 1624, it was captured by the Dutch and renamed Fort Frederick (honouring Prussia’s Frederick the Great) before falling into British hands until Sri Lanka’s independence in 1948. Jaffna and Trincomalee have hotels, mainly small, in all categories.  Tricomalee town and fishing harbour After checking in to Chaya Blue Resort, from our balcony, we watched the glorious sight of the scarlet sun accompanied by a blanket of streaks of orange clouds setting over the distant yellowish horizon as the blue waters of the lovely Indian Ocean lapped on the golden beaches of the beautiful port city of Trincomalee. As Lord Byron aptly described it, the music created by the roar of the waves and the rustling of the leaves on the coconut trees, was most soothing to our ears resulting in great relaxation of the mind. A comforting sea breeze caressed our bodies as we sat on the balcony. Thank God for the wondrous beauty of nature far away from the hustle and bustle of the City. A lone fisherman’s boat was paddling towards the beach after a hard day’s fishing tour and the holiday makers were strolling on the beach, while some were splashing around in the clear cool waters of the swimming pool below us. As Gentleman Jim sang ‘what a wonderful world’ it is. Trincomalee, is an anglicized form of the Tamil word “Tiru-kona-malai”, meaning “Lord of the Sacred Hill”; a reference to the town’s ancient Koneswaran Temple. Thiru comes from the Tamil for “sacred”, Kona means “Lord” or “Chief” in the language while Malai in Tamil means mountain or hill. Another meaning for the word Kona in Tamil is peak, and other definitions for Tirukonamalai include “sacred angular/peaked hill” or “three peaked hill”. Maritime and international trading history of Sri Lanka The town is situated on a hill at the end of a natural land formation that resembles an arc; the temple itself is built on Swami Rock, historically referred to as Kona-ma-malai, a cliff on the peninsula that drops 400 feet (120 metres) directly into the sea. It is a port city in the Eastern Province of Sri Lanka and lies on the east coast of the island, about 113 miles south of Jaffna. It has a population of approximately 100,000 (2007). The city is built on a peninsula, which divides the inner and outer harbours. Overlooking the Kottiyar Bay, Trincomalee is one of the main centres of Tamil speaking culture in Sri Lanka. People belonging to all races including the Tamil, Muslim and Sinhala communities in Trincomalee live in absolute harmony and mutual respect. The city has been a sea port that has played a major role in the maritime and international trading history of Sri Lanka. It is referred to as Gokanna in Pali or Gokarna in Sanskrit. The Bay of Trincomalee’s harbour is renowned for its large size and security; unlike every other in the Indian Ocean, it is accessible to all types of craft in all weathers. The beaches are used for surfing, scuba diving fishing and whale watching. The city also has the largest Dutch fort in Sri Lanka. It is home to major Sri Lankan Naval base and an Air Force Base. The entrance to the roadway leading to Koneswaram is actually the entrance to what used to be Fort Frederick. The fort was built in 1623 by the Portuguese and captured in 1639 by the Dutch. It then went through a phase of dismantling and reconstruction and was attacked and captured by the French in 1672. Trincomalee which is a natural deep-water harbour that has attracted seafarers like Marco Polo, Ptolemy and Sea Traders from China and East Asia since ancient times. Trinco, as it is commonly called, has been a sea port since the days of the ancient Sri Lankan Kings. The earliest known reference to the port of Gokanna is found in the Mahawamsa stating that in 5th Century BC, when King Vijaya who having failed to convince his brother to come to Sri Lanka as his successor, got down his youngest son Panduvasdeva, who landed at Gokanna and was subsequently enthroned at Upatissagama. King Parakramabahu used Gokanna (Trincomalee) as his eastern port, to launch a successful invasion of Burma in the 12th Century. By the late 16th century, Jaffna had given minimal logistical access to its Trincomalee and Batticaloa seaports to Kandy to secure military advantages against its enemies; this was utilized by their influential European overlords to consolidate power in the region. In 1612, D. Hieronymo de Azevedo, after great difficulties due to torrential rains arrived at Trincomalee with a Portuguese contingent from Kandy. Here de Azevedo was keen on building a fort. Asian seas The Danish arrived in Trincomalee to the end of 1619 with a first ship, called “Øresund” under the command of Roelant Crape, this small expedition, was the vanguard of another Danish fleet, this one composed by four vessels and three hundred soldiers, commanded by Ove Giedde, that reached the island in May 1620. They wanted to try their fortune in the Asian seas; the Danish expedition occupied Koneswaram temple and it was here that the Danes began the works for the fortification of the peninsula. In the year 1619, upon the Portuguese conquest, all the territory of the kingdom of Jaffna, comprised Trincomalee and Batticaloa, Trincomalee had a Portuguese force during the reign of Kandyan King Rajasinghe II. Rajasinghe finally ended with an alliance with Dutch and the Dutch invaded Kottyar Bay Fort as their first attack. The fall of the Kottyar Bay Fort was the first nail in the Portuguese coffin. An English sea captain and historical chronicle writer named Robert Knox came ashore by chance near Trincomalee and surrendered to the Dissawa (official) of the King of Kandy in 1659. Trincomalee was occupied by the Dutch, and subsequently by French alternately, until the capture of the fort there by the British in 1795. Trincomalee was the first land to be captured by the British who fought and defeated the Dutch, who did not want to surrender Ceylon as directed by the Prince of Orange, who took refuge in London after being defeated by the French republicans under Napoleon. As such, Trincomalee has served as an entrance to a Western invader from Calcutta.(Wikepedia) On January 8, 1782 the British captured the fort but the French recaptured it on August 29 of the same year. In 1783 the French ceded it to the British and subsequently Britain ceded it to the Dutch. In 1795 the British recaptured and held it until Sri Lanka’s independence in 1948. The importance of Fort Fredrick was due to Trincomalee’s natural harbour. Trincomalee’s strategic importance has shaped its recent history. Four European powers vied for mastery of the harbour. The Portuguese, the Dutch, the French, and the English, each held it in turn, and there have been many sea battles nearby. Prior to the Second World War the British had built a large airfield to house a permanent RAF base, RAF China Bay and a fuel storage and support facilities for the Royal Navy and HMS Highflyer naval base based there. After the fall of Singapore, Trincomalee became the home port of the Eastern Fleet of the Royal Navy, and submarines of the Dutch Navy. Until 1957, Trincomalee was an important base for the Royal Navy and was home to many British people who were employed by the British Admiralty. One of the places inhabited by the British was Fort Fredrick which is now occupied by the Sri Lankan Army. Some of the old buildings in the fort were used as residences, including one previously occupied by The Duke of Wellington. In the early 1950s the British Government built groups of bungalows within the Fort specifically for their employees. These bungalows still exist and provide accommodation for soldiers of the Sri Lankan Army. One of the groups of bungalows was named Edinburgh Terrace. Children of the British residents attended a Royal Naval School which was part of the Naval Base. The naval and air bases were taken over by Sri Lanka in 1957, today SLNS Tissa and SLN Dockyard are used by the Sri Lankan Navy while the Sri Lankan Air Force is based at SLAF China Bay. The Sri Lanka Army has its Security Headquarters-East in Trincomalee. Trincomalee War Cemetery, is one of the six commonwealth war cemeteries in Sri Lanka. The Navy Base is home to a naval museum called The Hoods Tower Museum. The name of the museum refers to a watchtower built on a hill commanding a 360-degree view of the harbour and the bay. Picturesque and scenic beaches Trincomalee is on the eastern end of the A6 and A 12 highways in Sri Lanka, as well as the northern end of the A 15. The city is also served by Sri Lanka Railways. Trincomalee Railway Station is the terminus of Trincomalee-bound services from Colombo Fort. The harbour, the fifth largest natural harbour in the world, is overlooked by terraced highlands, its entrance is guarded by two headlands, and there is a carriage road along its northern and eastern edges. Trincomalee has some of the most picturesque and scenic beaches found in Sri Lanka, relatively un-spoilt and clean. Nilaweli is a favourite beach among holidaymakers due to its beauty. The area is famous for bathing and swimming, owing to the relative shallowness of the sea, allowing one to walk out over a hundred meters into the sea without the water reaching the chest. Whale watching is a common pastime in the seas off Trincomalee, and successful sightings are on the rise with the increase of tourism in the area. There are the seven hot springs of Kanniya (Kal = stone; niya = land), on the road to Trincomalee. A high wall bounds the rectangular enclosure which includes all seven springs. Each is in turn enclosed by a dwarf wall to form a well. The water is warm, the temperature of each spring being slightly different. The use of the springs for bathing is controlled by the neighbouring Mari Amman Kovil, who holds the lease of the wells. Trincomalee’s location, in a less well developed and sparsely populated area, has in the past hampered its own development. Nevertheless plans are under way to develop the beautiful port city of Trincomalee as a commercial seaport and a popular tourist destination.

'Cops gone wild: The militarization of law enforcement in America','Ferguson, Mo. is a small overwhelmingly black town whose government and police are white. The Ferguson police murdered an 18 year old black kid who has his hands over his head. Moreover, it is unclear that the kid had committed any offense. If you take a look at the photo of the three goon thugs pointing military rifles in his face at point blank range, any one of the over-sized goons unarmed could have restrained the small kid. So what did the police goons do? They shot him to death. This is murder. There is no question whatsoever that it is murder. But it will be covered up by the white government and the white police force if protests are limited to the black small town population of Ferguson. Who cares about them? Justice? That’s only for the mega-rich. There is another astonishing aspect to the murder. Unarmed protesters in Ferguson are confronting a small town police force that is as well or better armed than America’s combat troops on battlefields in countries invaded by Washington. The only reason there is any trouble in Ferguson is that the cops murdered in cold blood a kid without cause or justification, and the black community knows that the white murderer will be given a pass by the white government. The part-time black US Attorney General, Eric Holder, has not sent in the Feds to investigate. It is not only in Ferguson that goon thug cops murder people and they don’t murder only blacks. Whites get it also. There are a huge number of murders by police in “the home of liberty and democracy.” During the course of Washington’s war in Iraq, American police murdered more innocent American civilians than America lost troops in the war! The American police murder so many civilians that it would take several thick volumes to record the police atrocities. The ones mentioned in this article are merely among the most recent that are reported. The Atlanta-Journal Constitution reports that a white 37-year old woman having a reaction to prescribed medication tried to call 911 for help but got instead a police goon thug who shot her dead up against the wall in her own bedroom. The police have put out the fake story that the woman in medical distress threatened the goon thug with a weapon. The newspaper reports that the woman’s husband also called 911, but fails to report that the husband said that he was headed home and would see that the emergency was dealt with only medically and not to send any police. But the goon thugs couldn’t miss the opportunity to murder another innocent American civilian. Police victims have no rights, and in the vast majority of cases neither do the families of the murdered police victims. Compensation to the families of murdered police victims is rare as is accountability for the police murderers. In America a police badge is a license to murder. During the past decade, perhaps longer, the federal government has systematically militarized local and state police forces in all 50 states. The police have been trained by federally contracted trainers to regard the American public as the enemy. The police are trained that they must not take the risk of encountering members of the public on a trusting basis, but must regard the public as armed and determined to murder the police. I have observed on a number of occasions fully militarily equipped police training by 30 of them lining up and emptying high capacity magazines at the same target. Like most small towns in America, Doraville, Georgia, population 8,500, has a SWAT team armed with the weapons of the US military. Congress should hold hearings to determine which federal budget was used to train state and local police to murder Americans. America has been at war for 13 years at vast costs against Muslims deemed to be a threat to our safety; yet American police have murdered more Americans than we lost in the Iraq war. We need to discover who trained our police to murder us, and we must hold both the criminals responsible for the “training” and the criminals in the government who financed the “training.” The most fatal mistake that any American can make is to call the police. With permission I republish my contribution to the summer issue of Gerald Celente’s Trends Journal: Police violence against the public soars In the 1960s, there was an effort in New York City to establish a civilian police review board. Complaints about police violence and harassment of black New Yorkers had grown to the point that the reality of the problem was obvious. New York Mayor John Lindsay was amenable, but conservatives led by William F. Buckley and the police rose up in arms. The conservative media called the police review board “the property of bleeding hearts and cop-haters.” Fear-mongering was used to rally white voters, who were told that the review board would coddle criminals, demoralize the police, and lead to an upsurge in crime. Mayor Lindsay established a review board by executive order, but rising opposition forced the supporters of the review board to put it to a vote. Fear had done its job, and the review board was abolished by a vote of 63 per cent against and 36 per cent in favour. This from “liberal New York.” In the half-century that has passed, gratuitous police violence has spread to the public in general. Today it is not only blacks and Hispanics who experience police brutality. Everyone suffers from it. Being white is no longer a protection. In a recent column, “Call the Cops at Your Peril,” I reported a few of the recent atrocities police have committed against the public. Ninety-three-year-old Pearlie Golden was shot down in her front yard in Hearne, Texas. In Miami, 23 police officers fired 377 bullets, literally blowing away two men trapped inside a wrecked car. The police were under no threat whatsoever from the 93-year-old woman or from the two men trapped inside a wrecked car. In Cornelia, Georgia, a SWAT team made a no-knock entry at 3 a.m. and threw a concussion grenade into a baby’s crib. The grenade blew up in the baby’s face, leaving him disfigured, unable to breathe without a ventilator, and with a 50 per cent chance of survival. According to the Atlanta Constitution-Journal, the raid produced no drugs, no weapons, no bundles of cash, and no suspected drug dealer. It was just another of the thousands of mistakes routinely made by SWAT goons who put American citizens at risk every time they break unannounced into a home, usually a wrong address. New tactic: Kill the dog A police favourite is to murder the family’s pets. When the Middletons, ranchers in Rains County, Texas, called the sheriff’s department to report a burglary of their home and the theft of firearms, the first thing the deputy did when he arrived was to shoot the Middleton’s three-year-old, 40-pound Australian cattle dog, Candy, in the head. In Prince George’s County, Maryland, cops on a mistaken drug raid broke into the mayor’s home and murdered his two non-aggressive black Labradors while holding the mayor and his mother-in-law at gun point. Another police favourite is to humiliate their arrested victim, especially women, by stripping them naked. The abuse of women has become routine. In a recent case, a 31-year-old white mother of four in New Albany, Indiana, was arrested for disorderly conduct and resisting arrest after a fight with her estranged husband. In police parlance, disorderly conduct and resisting arrest mean that the woman protested the false arrest and raised her voice. As most Americans have no idea about the police, they are shocked and disbelieving when they experience a police encounter. Until they have an encounter with the police, they are big supporters of the police. Unable to believe what was happening to her, she was stripped of her clothing by two male and two female cops, paraded around the jail naked in front of the police, and thrown naked into a cell. She became hysterical as a result of this treatment. Enjoying their torment of their victim, the cops pepper sprayed her. The county sheriff said that he does not believe jail policies or procedures were violated. In other words, the sheriff admitted that abuse, humiliation and excessive use of force are routine. http://www.infowars.com/cops-strip-parade-pepper-spray-woman-and-lock-he... Also: http://www.policestateusa.com/2014/tabitha-gentry/ As I write, I googled “videos of US police brutality” and 7,660,000 results appeared in 0.31 seconds. There are more cases of gratuitous police violence, almost always against the innocent, than a person can absorb in a lifetime. Police body slam elderly infirm people, taser cripples in wheel chairs, pepper spray, taser, and mace kids, young women, and mothers with babes in their arms. Just the other day police shot and killed a 13-year-old kid who was walking down the street with a toy rifle doing no harm to anyone. Only the goon cops regarded the 13-year-old as a threat. The goon cops simply couldn’t let the opportunity pass to experience the thrill of killing a person. We see the same thing in the US military video released by Bradley Manning of the US helicopter gunship murdering journalists and citizens walking peacefully along a street and then murdering a father with two babies who stopped to help the wounded. Nothing happened to the murderers, but Bradley Manning was imprisoned for telling on them. We are at the point that the police try to murder teenagers making out in a parked car. http://www.lewrockwell.com/2014/06/no_author/cop-shoots-teenage-couple/ We have become a killer society, and the US government is the world’s leading killer. Who’s the real danger The cases of gratuitous police violence against the public are so numerous that it is impossible to report on them. All that can be done is to categorize them into types. The conclusion is that the police are a far greater danger to the public than are criminals. Moreover, the police are unaccountable. They can murder with impunity, but if you even accidentally or reflexively touch one of them, it is off to prison with you if you survive the beating. Cecily McMillan, about whom I recently wrote, was an Occupy protester. Her breasts were seized from behind by a cop. Reflexively, her elbow came up as she swung around and her elbow hit the cop. Recently a cowardly or corrupt jury, egged on by a corrupt judge and prosecutor, found her guilty of assaulting an officer and she was sentenced to prison. Nothing happened to the cop who sexually assaulted and falsely arrested her. Prosecutors are interested in convictions, not justice. Prosecutors routinely indict the innocent on the basis of the false charges brought by police, and judges often are complicit in the false convictions. No honest prosecutor would have brought the case against Cecily McMillan. Her trial was a political trial, and her conviction was a foregone conclusion. The purpose was to send the message that regardless of constitutional rights, protests against the Establishment are not permitted. The judge guaranteed her conviction by ruling that no evidence of the injury to her breast could be presented in her defense and that the jurors could not be informed of the arresting officer’s record of excessive use of force and abuse of citizens. The jury was unwilling to stand up for an innocent person. Instead of serving justice, the jury served the corrupt purpose of the police state. See http://www.opednews.com/articles/The-Betrayal-of-Cecily-McM-by-Marc-Ash-... and http://www.paulcraigroberts.org/2014/05/21/justice-dead-amerika/ Whatever the police do, seldom do they suffer any consequences. As a result they have become more bold and more violent. Any encounter with the American police is a dangerous one. The “war on terror” has removed any remaining constraints on police. The federal government has militarized state and local police and equipped them as if they were a military force. The police are trained to regard the public as a danger and to take no risk with their lives when confronting citizens. The police are taught that politely asking questions in order to arrive at an assessment of a situation could expose them to danger and that they should avoid all risk to themselves by dominating the situation with force just as an army or marine unit would do when confronting an enemy. I have witnessed training exercises at which 30 police officers line up and empty high capacity magazines at the same target. We are talking about 450 shots in a few seconds at one head-sized target. It was this type of training that resulted in 23 cops pouring 377 bullets into two men in Miami, one of whom was totally innocent of any charges. SWAT teams have become ubiquitous and they are armed with tanks, with MRAPs (Mine-Resistant Ambush Protected Armored Fighting Vehicles), and BearCat Ballistic Engineered Armored Response Counter Attack Trucks. These military vehicles are in routine use, and the SWAT team breaking down your door has replaced the policeman knocking to present a summons. http://rt.com/usa/164816-american-police-militarization-war/ It once was the case that joining the police force implied low-level risk. An officer could, and occasionally did, die in performing his duty. Today no level of risk is acceptable for police. Therefore, all risk has been shifted to the public anytime members of the public have encounters, mistaken or not, with the police. Consequently, police kill far more innocent members of the public than criminals kill police. The police have become like Wall Street and the federal government. The police serve no public interest. When I was growing up in the forties and fifties, we understood that the police force attracted bullies because of the power of the badge, but unlike today the police did not have carte blanche. In the forties and fifties the American people had not been reduced to powerlessness or to the sheeple that they are today. Newspapers were still independently owned and served as a constraint on police power. Blacks did not always get this protection, but in large southern cities, such as Atlanta, where Ralph McGill was editor and publisher of the Atlanta Constitution, blacks, too, had the protection of the press. I remember the first civil rights march in Atlanta. There were no police and no dogs set on the marchers. I know because I was there. Bullies were one thing, but there was not the hostility toward the public that is ingrained in police training today. Standing up for one’s constitutional rights in a police encounter today is a perfect way to enrage a bully whose authority is questioned. The likely result is a beating and arrest. Subservience is the easiest way to survive a police encounter. You might be a brain surgeon or a former high government official and the cop might be someone who barely made it out of high school. But if you want to get out of it without damage to your body and charges on your record, act like a peasant confronted by a baron, earl or duke centuries ago. This is America today. Anything else and you might be history. So, are police review boards the answer? Apparently not. In 1993, 27 years after New York Mayor Lindsay’s failed attempt to impose some accountability on police, Mayor David Dinkins established the largely powerless Civilian Complaint Review Board. The police rose up in opposition and were egged on by Rudy Giuliani, who when he became mayor gave the police carte blanche. White New Yorkers applauded Giuliani. Finally, they were safe again — as long as they did not have a run-in with the police or the SWAT team didn’t go to the wrong address, perhaps a more likely occurrence than a criminal showing up at the door. A number of cities today have review boards. Some have powers. Most don’t. Even those with powers have been made hesitant to use them. When terror is such a threat that the country remains on Orange Alert, one step below Red Alert, for years, only a terrorist-loving liberal-pinko-commie would want to restrain the police. As long as the US remains in the hands of the Establishment, police review boards will be ineffective. Wikipedia reports that in 2006, eight years ago, the NY Civilian Complaint Review Board received 7,699 complaints, approximately 6\% resulted in a “substantiated disposition.” In other words, 94\% of the cases went nowhere. The police have been set loose on us by “law and order” conservatives and by the “war on terror.” The police are doing us far more damage than are the criminals and the terrorists. It remains to be seen whether Americans survive their police. In the meantime the sheeple will continue to pay the salaries of those who pose the greatest threat to them. Courtesy: GlobalResearch',No
'One phrase can come ablaze with double entendre','The very editorial from where this column is published and its Sunday sister journal were the most exciting places to have worked in during the early sixties and late seventies. Certainly it was a phase in the profession which many regard as the ‘Golden Age’ of Sri Lankan journalism. In an editorial environment peopled by a bunch of wisecracking hacks, several of whom could have equalled or surpassed their contemporaries in any international newsroom, they strode the expansive corridors of Lake House with a condescending vivacity. A good number of them were lightning quick on the draw and were unquestionably the sharpest and quickest wits in the fraternity. Surely, for that unruly, irreverent bunch of newspapermen the pun was mightier than the sword and far more potent than the commonplace word. Needless to say, the whole setting was a barrel of pun. That was because too many of them had naughty pun-track minds! Newsrooms then were the theatre for colourful language because of the high pressure the job entailed. Of course one heard swearing in the newsrooms of journals all over the world. In the old days, pencil points kept snapping, abused typewriter keys punched in blanks. It usually occurred during the pre-calm witching hour when deadlines were getting too perilously close for comfort. The profanities then become thicker and more imaginative as tempers flared. If that happened to any mortal and he didn’t swear, then I could swear that the person would have been a sure candidate for sainthood. People with undeveloped dirty minds were always a disadvantaged lot in the business. And it could be doubly dangerous particularly for those possessing limited vocabularies and inadequate double meaning imaginations to boot. Newsrooms in their halcyon days were chaotic places. They were madcap menageries too wild for the innocent-minded, particularly women. I mentioned before that one of the most uncontaminated minds I once worked with was a mature housewife who glided into journalism quite late in life. Certainly Mrs. S. was a venerable personage and appeared to be the epitome of innocence. She possessed a good vocabulary but was completely unacquainted with the dangers of double entendre. As you are probably aware double entendres are phrases or sentences that can be interpreted in two different ways. One of which is usually dirty. Often, they are words which though innocuous can have strong sensual or risqué overtones.  The venerable lady became a legend in the workplace as a result of her many unintentional double entendres which became part of journalistic mythology. She once had put in a requisition for a file cover. An administrative assistant walked up to her desk and inquired: “What kind of file do you require Mrs. S? Do you want a small one, regular-sized one or a huge one?” Thanking the man pleasantly she answered: “I want a huge one! Do you have a huge one?” On another occasion the staff was distressed when a newly married woman sub-editor had met with a road accident on the her way to her honeymoon. Both the bride and her husband suffered a few minor scratches. Mrs. S., quite concerned about the mishap commented: “Poor thing! And it’s so unfortunate the honeymoon had to come to a grinding halt!” She hated when her headlines or writing were changed. She made several accusations about the crusty old chief-sub-editor about such amendments. She complained vociferously: “That old Mr. Van is always fiddling and diddling with my stuff!” There was a moment of stunned silence and then the unbridled laugher echoed through the building. She also whined to me about his continuous nitpicking over her writing and headlines. I tried to comfort her with the explanation: “Don’t worry about what he has to say. He comes from a family of oddballs.’ Pat came her naive answer: “Really! I would like to see them all!” It just went to fortify the reality that thought perversions were completely beyond the good lady’s mindset. Even the most chronically incurable masters of profanity bit their lips in frustration and held back their cuss words when the venerable presence of Mrs. S. was within earshot. Fortunately for everyone concerned she was slightly hard of hearing. Yet, whispered vulgarities do not have the same effect as those unleashed with a guttural roar to release newsroom frustrations. So the editorial secretary was prevailed upon to change the seating arrangements and Mrs. S’s desk and chair were moved to the furthest corner of the editorial to spare her the blushes of hearing irreverent journalistic jargon. On arrival the following morning she was offended at the change. Certainly, she was not the type to play Little Jack Horner or his feminine counterpart without emerging swinging from her corner. She burst into the Editor-in-Chief’s sanctum all guns blazing! Legendary Editor Denzil Peiris who was totally unaware of what had transpired appeared quite flummoxed when confronted by the sudden intrusion. She then fired straight from the lip: “Mr. Peiris, I will not tolerate this humiliating treatment!” Denzil warily asked her: “Tolerate what treatment, my dear?” Her answer exploded in his ear like a pistol shot. For a few moments the involuntary twitch of Denzil’s eyebrow muscles increased in frequency as the unintended double entendre sank in. He then excused himself and made a hurried exit chortling all the way to his deputy’s office to be enlightened on what all the fuss was about. The deputy editor queried: “What the heck did she tell you?” Amid stutters and chuckles Denzil managed to repeat the complaint: “She said...she actually said... I refuse to be poked in a corner!” gdgasross@gmail.com ',No
'[ESSENCE - (19-08-2014)]','Saffron is some lovely stuff! Saffron is one of the highly prized spices known since antiquity for its colour, flavour and medicinal properties. It is the dried “stigma” or threads of the flower of the S. crocus plant. The plant is a bulbous perennial plant that belongs to the family of Iridaceae, in the genus, Crocus, and known botanically as Crocus sativus. This exotic spice is a native of Southern Europe and now cultivated worldwide in many countries, particularly in Spain, Italy, France, Greece, Turkey, Iran, and in the Indian state of Jammu and Kashmir. The Crocus sativus plant grows to about 15-20cm in height and bears lavender coloured flowers during each season, which lasts from October until November. Each flower features perianth, which consists of a stalk, known as “style,” connecting to the three “stigmas” or threads to the rest of the plant. These orange-yellow coloured stigmas along with the “style” constitute ÓsaffronÓ which is used as a spice. Health benefits of Saffron Saffron contains many plants derived chemical compounds that are known to have been anti-oxidant, disease preventing, and health promoting properties. The active components in saffron have many therapeutic applications in many traditional medicines as antiseptic, antidepressant, anti-oxidant, digestive, anti-convulsant. This novel spice is a good source of minerals like copper, potassium, calcium, manganese, iron, selenium, zinc and magnesium. Potassium is an important component of cell and body fluids that helps control heart rate and blood pressure. Culinary Uses Just a pinch of fresh saffron is enough to enhance the flavour and colour the entire recipe. There are several methods to use it in the kitchen. Whole stigma can be added directly to the preparations, or oftentimes, the threads are ground to paste using traditional mortar and pestle, and added to the recipes. In the third method, a pinch of saffron is added to a cup of hot water, steep; add this water to the recipes. Here are some serving tips Saffron stigmas have been used as flavouring base and colouring base in both food and drinks in Mediterranean, and Asian cuisines. Popularly known as ÓkesarÓ in Indian subcontinent, it has been in use in the preparation rice-pulov, as well as rice-pudding, “halwa” and other sweet dishes in many Indian, Pakistani, and Cental Asian countries. It is also used as a colour and flavouring base in the preparation of kulfi, ice-creams, cakes and drinks. Safety profile High doses of saffron can act as uterine stimulant and in severe cases can cause miscarriage. Therefore, pregnant women may be advised to avoid this spice in the diet.

(express.co.uk) Tips for Everyday Etiquettes There are times throughout every day of your life when you have to make a choice of whether to use good etiquette or be a clod. Please, for the sake of humanity and civility, take the high road and be a lady or gentleman. Even under the most trying of situations, it isn’t that much more difficult, and you’ll feel better later if you do the right thing. Be Friendly and Polite If you step outside your house during the day, you’re likely to encounter people, so try to be friendly. Even on miserable days when everything seems to be going wrong, forcing a smile has the potential to lift the mood of not only the person you’re looking at but yours as well. Offer a greeting, and you might even see an extra ray of sunshine. Certain words carry a tremendous amount of power when you care enough to be polite and civil to others. Add “please,” “thank you,” “you’re welcome,” and “excuse me” to your vocabulary, and you may find others responding with reciprocated kindness. Be On Time Avoid being late for an appointment with anyone, whether it’s your doctor or your child. Being on time shows your respect for the other person. Be a Helper You don’t have to be a Boy Scout to help out your fellow citizen. If you see someone whose arms are overloaded with packages, open the door. Also, if you have just entered a building and someone is right behind you, hold the door to keep it from slamming in his or her face. Respect Others When you interact with other people, you need to respect them. Allow others to voice their opinions without argument. Respect their personal space as you would want others to respect yours. When you are in the company of someone of greater authority, show him or her proper respect. The old saying “If you don’t have anything nice to say, then don’t say anything” is wise and should be followed in most social situations. You’ll avoid having to backtrack or explain if you keep your snarky thoughts to yourself. Let Others Go First If you can let others go first without awkwardness, then do it. This includes walking, standing in line, and driving. A woman with small children will appreciate getting through the checkout lane quickly, particularly if her children are hungry or bored. If a driver needs to move into your lane, and you can let him in without the person behind you rear-ending you, then gesture for him to go ahead. Hold Down the Noise This world has become too noisy, so try not to add to it. Keep your cell phone ringer volume as low as possible. If you work in an office cubicle, be considerate of your fellow office mates by keeping your voice low while chatting on the phone. Don’t honk at other drivers unless it’s to avoid an accident. (etiquette.about.com) Animals in the deep sea, how they survive Organisms that live in the perpetual darkness and extreme pressures of the deep sea have a variety of bizarre and ingenious adaptations to enable them to survive. In the twilight zone between 200 and 1,000 metres, animals are often equipped with huge eyes to find food and mates, and to evade predators. The giant squid Architeuthis dux was eyes the size of dinner plates. In the total darkness found past 1,000 metres, many deep-sea animals have evolved light-producing organs that are used either for recognition or as lures to catch prey. With no phytoplankton (microscopic plants) available as a primary food source, the inhabitants of the deep must rely on a slow, steady rain of waste food particles from above, or hunt and scavenge in the darkness. Sometimes, a shipwreck or the carcass of a large organism such as a whale or the trunk of a tree will arrive on the seabed and the slow pace of life is transformed as a range of animals take advantage of the nutritional bonanza, which can last a number of years.

'A TERRIBLE NORMALITY: THE MASSACRES AND ABERRATIONS OF HISTORY','Through much of history the abnormal has been the norm. This is a paradox to which we should attend. Aberrations, so plentiful as to form a terrible normality of their own, descend upon us with frightful consistency. The number of massacres in history, for instance, are almost more than we can record. There was the New World holocaust, consisting of the extermination of indigenous Native American peoples throughout the Western hemisphere, extending over four centuries or more, continuing into recent times in the Amazon region. There were the centuries of heartless slavery in the Americas and elsewhere, followed by a full century of lynch mob rule and Jim Crow segregation in the United States, and today the numerous killings and incarcerations of Black youth by law enforcement agencies. Let us not forget the extermination of some 200,000 Filipinos by the U.S. military at the beginning of the twentieth century, the genocidal massacre of 1.5 million Armenians by the Turks in 1915, and the mass killings of African peoples by the Western colonists, including the 63,000 Herero victims in German Southwest Africa in 1904, and the brutalization and enslavement of millions in the Belgian Congo from the late 1880s until emancipation in 1960-followed by years of neocolonial free-market exploitation and repression in what was Mobutu\'s Zaire. French colonizers killed some 150,000 Algerians. Later on, several million souls perished in Angola and Mozambique along with an estimated five million in the merciless region now known as the Democratic Republic of the Congo. World War I and World War II The twentieth century gave us-among other horrors-more than sixteen million lost and twenty million wounded or mutilated in World War I, followed by the estimated 62 million to 78 million killed in World War II, including some 24 million Soviet military personnel and civilians, 5.8 million European Jews, and taken together: several million Serbs, Poles, Roma, homosexuals, and a score of other nationalities. In the decades after World War II, many, if not most, massacres and wars have been openly or covertly sponsored by the U.S. national security state. This includes the two million or so left dead or missing in Vietnam, along with 250,000 Cambodians, 100,000 Laotians, and 58,000 Americans. Today in much of Africa, Central Asia, and the Middle East there are \"smaller\" wars, replete with atrocities of all sorts. Central America, Colombia, Rwanda and other places too numerous to list, suffered the massacres and death-squad exterminations of hundreds of thousands, a constancy of violent horrors. In Mexico a \"war on drugs\" has taken 70,000 lives with 8,000 missing. There was the slaughter of more than half a million socialistic or democratic nationalist Indonesians by the U.S.-supported Indonesian military in 1965, eventually followed by the extermination of 100,000 East Timorese by that same U.S.-backed military. Consider the 78-days of NATO\'s aerial destruction of Yugoslavia complete with depleted uranium, and the bombings and invasion of Panama, Grenada, Somalia, Libya, Yemen, Western Pakistan, Afghanistan, and now the devastating war of attrition brokered against Syria. And as I write (early 2013), the U.S.-sponsored sanctions against Iran are seeding severe hardship for the civilian population of that country. All the above amounts to a very incomplete listing of the world\'s violent and ugly injustice. A comprehensive inventory would fill volumes. How do we record the countless other life-searing abuses: the many millions who survive wars and massacres but remain forever broken in body and spirit, left to a lifetime of suffering and pitiless privation, refugees without sufficient food or medical supplies or water and sanitation services in countries like Syria, Haiti, South Sudan, Ethiopia, Somalia, and Mali. Think of the millions of women and children around the world and across the centuries who have been trafficked in unspeakable ways, and the millions upon millions trapped in exploitative toil, be they slaves, indentured servants, or underpaid labourers. The number of impoverished is now growing at a faster rate than the world\'s population. Add to that, the countless acts of repression, incarceration, torture, and other criminal abuses that beat upon the human spirit throughout the world day-by-day. Let us not overlook the ubiquitous corporate corruption and massive financial swindles, the plundering of natural resources and industrial poisoning of whole regions, the forceful dislocation of entire populations, the continuing catastrophes of Chernobyl and Fukushima and other impending disasters awaiting numerous aging nuclear reactors. The world\'s dreadful aberrations are so commonplace and unrelenting that they lose their edge and we become inured to the horror of it all. \"Who today remembers the Armenians?\" Hitler is quoted as having said while plotting his \"final solution\" for the Jews. Who today remembers the Iraqis and the death and destruction done to them on a grand scale by the U.S. invasion of their lands? William Blum reminds us that more than half the Iraq population is either dead, wounded, traumatized, imprisoned, displaced, or exiled, while their environment is saturated with depleted uranium (from U.S. weaponry) inflicting horrific birth defects. Protecting U.S. national interests What is to be made of all this? First, we must not ascribe these aberrations to happenstance, innocent confusion, and unintended consequences. Nor should we believe the usual rationales about spreading democracy, fighting terrorism, providing humanitarian rescue, protecting U.S. national interests and other such rallying cries promulgated by ruling elites and their mouthpieces. The repetitious patterns of atrocity and violence are so persistent as to invite the suspicion that they usually serve real interests; they are structural not incidental. All this destruction and slaughter has greatly profited those plutocrats who pursue economic expansion, resource acquisition, territorial dominion, and financial accumulation. Ruling interests are well served by their superiority in firepower and striking force. Violence is what we are talking about here, not just the wild and wanton type but the persistent and well-organized kind. As a political resource, violence is the instrument of ultimate authority. Violence allows for the conquest of entire lands and the riches they contain, while keeping displaced labourers and other slaves in harness. The plutocratic rulers find it necessary to misuse or exterminate restive multitudes, to let them starve while the fruits of their land and the sweat of their labour enrich privileged coteries. Thus we had a profit-driven imperial rule that helped precipitate the great famine in northern China, 1876-1879, resulting in the death of some thirteen million. At about that same time the Madras famine in India took the lives of as many as twelve million while the colonial forces grew ever richer. And thirty years earlier, the great potato famine in Ireland led to about one million deaths, with another desperate million emigrating from their homeland. Nothing accidental about this: while the Irish starved, their English landlords exported shiploads of Irish grain and livestock to England and elsewhere at considerable profit to themselves. These occurrences must be seen as something more than just historic abnormalities floating aimlessly in time and space, driven only by overweening impulse or happenstance. It is not enough to condemn monstrous events and bad times, we also must try to understand them. They must be contextualized in the larger framework of historical social relations. The dominant socio-economic system today is free-market capitalism (in all its variations). Along with its unrelenting imperial terrorism, free-market capitalism provides \"normal abnormalities\" from within its own dynamic, creating scarcity and maldistributed excess, filled with duplication, waste, overproduction, frightening environmental destruction, and varieties of financial crises, bringing swollen rewards to a select few and continual hardship to multitudes. Economic crises are not exceptional; they are the standing operational mode of the capitalist system. Once again, the irrational is the norm. Consider U.S. free-market history: after the American Revolution, there were the debtor rebellions of the late 1780s, the panic of 1792, the recession of 1809 (lasting several years), the panics of 1819 and 1837, and recessions and crashes through much of the rest of that century. The serious recession of 1893 continued for more than a decade. After the industrial underemployment of 1900 to 1915 came the agrarian depression of the 1920s-hidden behind what became known to us as \"the Jazz Age,\" followed by a horrendous crash and the Great Depression of 1929-1942. All through the twentieth century we had wars, recessions, inflation, labour struggles, high unemployment-hardly a year that would be considered \"normal\" in any pleasant sense. An extended normal period would itself have been an abnormality. The free market is by design inherently unstable in every aspect other than wealth accumulation for the select few. What we are witnessing is not an irrational output from a basically rational society but the converse: the \"rational\" (to be expected) output of a fundamentally irrational system. Does this mean these horrors are inescapable? No, they are not made of supernatural forces. They are produced by plutocratic greed and deception. So, if the aberrant is the norm and the horrific is chronic, then we in our fightback should give less attention to the idiosyncratic and more to the systemic. Wars, massacres and recessions help to increase capital concentration, monopolize markets and natural resources, and destroy labour organizations and popular transformative resistance. Atrocities and wars The brutish vagaries of plutocracy are not the product of particular personalities but of systemic interests. President George W. Bush was ridiculed for misusing words, but his empire-building and stripping of government services and regulations revealed a keen devotion to ruling-class interests. Likewise, President Barack Obama is not spineless. He is hypocritical but not confused. He is (by his own description) an erstwhile \"liberal Republican,\" or as I would put it, a faithful servant of corporate America. Our various leaders are well informed, not deluded. They come from different regions and different families, and have different personalities, yet they pursue pretty much the same policies on behalf of the same plutocracy. So it is not enough to denounce atrocities and wars, we also must understand who propagates them and who benefits. We have to ask why violence and deception are constant ingredients. Unintended consequences and other oddities do arise in worldly affairs but we also must take account of interest-driven rational intentions. More often than not, the aberrations-be they wars, market crashes, famines, individual assassinations or mass killings-take shape because those at the top are pursuing gainful expropriation. Many may suffer and perish but somebody somewhere is benefiting boundlessly. Knowing your enemies and what they are capable of doing is the first step toward effective opposition. The world becomes less of a horrific puzzlement. We can only resist these global (and local) perpetrators when we see who they are and what they are doing to us and our sacred environment. Democratic victories, however small and partial they be, must be embraced. But the people must not be satisfied with tinseled favours offered by smooth leaders. We need to strive in every way possible for the revolutionary unravelling, a revolution of organized consciousness striking at the empire\'s heart with the full force of democracy, the kind of irresistible upsurge that seems to come from nowhere while carrying everything before it.

'Former war zones in Sri Lanka now fight for tourists','Two Sri Lankan cities at the heart of a 25-year civil war are creeping back onto the tourist trail.  Since the war ended five years ago, more tourists are exploring this South Asian country. The word “serendipity” — describing happy discoveries made accidentally — is derived from Serendip, an ancient name for Sri Lanka. Slightly smaller than Tasmania but with a population as big as Australia’s, teardrop-shaped Sri Lanka has an elaborate network of mostly narrow paved roads winding from the coast to its tea-growing hinterland. Holiday-makers kept coming — enticed by bargain-basement prices, high-quality resorts, cut-price shopping, good beaches and attractions ranging from ancient cities to wildlife parks with large populations of elephants and other animals. The war was a conflict between a Hindu Tamil minority and a Buddhist Sinhalese majority. Central to the conflict were the north’s main city, Jaffna, and its mainly Tamil surrounds, along with the northeast’s hub, Trincomalee. Neither saw many visitors. Economic potential Officials in both regions see economic potential and now want slices of the tourism cake.  Enjoying the scenic beauty of Pigeon Island, Trincomalee  Both have many small hotels, with large resort-style properties set to follow as wait-and-see investors gamble that peace will hold. Already, Jaffna and Trincomalee are seeing trickles of tourists. Jaffna, closest to India and a major centre of Hindu culture, bills itself as Sri Lanka’s “final frontier” while Trincomalee touts rich history and some of Asia’s most alluring white-sand beaches. I feel tipped into a time-warp along Jaffna’s Hospital Road, the main drag. Old Morris and Austin cars are everywhere. “I’ll buy a few and ship them home,” confides a car collector from Canada as we admire an Austin Cambridge. More modern vehicles are increasingly seen but, as residents tell me, old British cars became workhorses during sieges — many as taxis and others as private cars. Tables groan with fish and fruit at Jaffna’s municipal market. People are friendly. Even uniformed Sinhalese soldiers are unarmed. At the Rosarian Sisters’ Ashram, I meet Catholic nuns who buy grapes to make wine. But they don’t drink it themselves. “It wouldn’t be proper for nuns to drink,” Sister Perpetua insists. Nearby, Rosarian monks make table and communion wine. “I suppose they drink it,” shrugs the abstemious nun. A taxi whisks me to the Church of Christ, a bombed-out shell. Downtown, the historic Jaffna Library — once again operating — is one of many restored buildings. The Clock Tower, a formerly derelict landmark, has been painted and is again keeping time. Colourfully decorated Hindu temples dot Jaffna. Day trips cross narrow causeways connecting Jaffna Peninsula to the islands of Kayts (with a busy fishing harbour and splendid beaches), Punkudutivu and Karaitivu. More distant and reached by ferry is a popular backpacker destination, sparsely vegetated Delft — a windswept isle of defiant grasses and sandy beaches boasting an old Dutch fort. Back on the mainland, I wander through a bizarre grove of palm trees: just trunks — with treetops blasted away by artillery as reminders of troubled times. World’s second-biggest natural harbour Trincomalee is renowned for diving amid sunken ships and aircraft. Its other dive sites are similarly rich in tropical fish and colourful coral, including gathering places of moray eels and manta rays. Diving locations are close to Trincomalee’s two best beaches, Nilaveli and Uppaveli. From Nilaveli it’s a 3km boat ride to Pigeon Island, most of which is Pigeon Island National Park. Upscale Pigeon Island Beach Resort has a beach ideal for lazing, with an adjoining Beach Bar spilling onto the sand. Diving, snorkelling and swimming are on tap — as are excursions to nearby hot springs. An amble takes me to several Hindu temples, the most visited of which is Kali Kovil from where it’s not far to blue-hued and 162-year-old St Mary’s (Catholic) Cathedral. The cathedral proves serene prelude to the boisterous local fish market, a place of high-decibel haggling at the edge of what’s claimed to be the world’s second-biggest natural harbour. Top of Trincomalee’s list of attractions is thick-walled Fort Frederick. Built by the Portuguese in 1624, it was captured by the Dutch and renamed Fort Frederick (honouring Prussia’s Frederick the Great) before falling into British hands until Sri Lanka’s independence in 1948. Outside Fort Frederick, I meet an Australian couple who visited Jaffna before their three-day Trincomalee stay. They found on-foot investigation to be both peaceful and ideally suited — a reality at odds with their preconceptions about former war zones. “Both places seem poised to develop rapidly,” says the woman. Adds her husband: “We wanted to be a few steps ahead of the crowds.” Courtesy: news.com.au ',No
'[ESSENCE- (26-08-2014)]','INTERESTING FACTS ABOUT AVIATION  There are probably no people who would deny the importance of aviation in today’s fast moving world. The question is how much do we really know about aviation? Have you ever wondered of how many parts the aircraft that you are sitting in is made of? Or what do pilots eat? Undoubtedly, there are countless interesting and surprising facts about aviation which may surprise you. That is the reason why Baltic Aviation Academy has chosen to come up with the list of the most astonishing facts about aviation. Who knows, maybe after reading this article you will be able to add some new facts about aviation and pilot profession to your knowledge pool. 1. Pilots eat a different meal There are various rules which are imposed by different airlines. However, there is one rule which is common to the vast majority of them. It is the rule that pilots must be fed the same multi-course meal given to those in the first and business class whilst the co-pilots are encouraged to eat different entrees to guard against cases of food poisoning. 2. A Boeing 747 is made up of six million parts Boeing 747 is the most well known wide-body commercial airliner and cargo transportation aircraft frequently referred to as the Queen of the Skies or the Jumbo Jet. This airplane is famed because it was the first huge body aircraft ever produced. A Boeing 747 is made up of six million parts which are made to be all controlled by a few pilots sitting up front with switches and buttons under their fingertips. 3. More than 80\% of the population is afraid of flying Acrophobia is defined as a fear of heights. Unlike a specific phobia like aerophobia - fear of flying -and other specific phobias, acrophobia can cause a person to fear a variety of things related to being far from the ground. Depending on the severity of the phobia, an acrophobic person may equally fear being on a high floor of a building or simply climbing a ladder. 4. Each engine on a Boeing 747 weighs almost 9,500 pounds Another interesting fact about a Boeing 747 concerns its engine weight. This aircraft is one of the most popular and beautiful airliners in the sky. A Boeing 747 is made up of six million parts and one of them is its engine which weighs almost 9,500 pounds (4,300 kg) and costs about 8 million USD. 5. The world’s busiest commercial airport The busiest commercial airport in the world is the Hartsfield- Jackson Airport (ATL) in Atlanta, with more than 970.000 airplane movements a year. Based on its passenger traffic this airport has been the busiest from 1998, and by the number of landings and take-offs - since 2005. The Hartsfield–Jackson has held its ranking as the world’s busiest airport in 2012, too, both in terms of the number of passengers and the number of flights. In the year alone it was visited by95 million passengers (more than 260,000 passengers daily). 6. The speed of a Boeing 747 Boeing 747 is not only one of the world’s most recognizable aircraft, and the first wide-body ever produced. Another fascinating fact about this aircraft is that the maximum speed of a Boeing 747 is 955 km/h. 7. Only 5\% of the world’s population have ever been on an airplane Though the aviation sector is growing rapidly, according to the statistics only 5\% of the world’s population has ever flown on an airplane. Many people, especially from the underdeveloped regions, have never ever been in an aircraft and it is not likely that they will have an opportunity to fly in all of their lives. However, at the same time a small minority of the world’s population fly very regularly. 8. The average age of a commercial aircraft The lifespan of an airliner is not truly measured in time. Instead, it is counted based on pressurization cycles. Each time an aircraft is pressurized during a flight its fuselage is subjected to stress. The “lifespan” of an aircraft is reached when there are certain metal fatigues and cracks which may pose danger. The “service life of 20 years” is generally expressed by approximate figures of 51,000 flight hours and 75,000 pressurization cycles for most aircraft. If an aircraft is used on long haul routes it experiences relatively few pressurization cycles in its “life” and can remain airworthy far beyond 20 years. 9. The world’s most frequent flyer Tom Stuker has taken the term “frequent flyer” to completely new heights this year, logging just over 1.000.000 miles in 2012 all on United, all in first class. Generally, he has travelled over 10 million miles. The 59-year-old Chicago native and New Jersey resident says he’s flown a total of 13 million miles, much of that in his capacity as an independent consultant and sales trainer for automobile dealerships around the world. (www.balticaa.com) Bipasha Basu haunted by ‘Creature’ in real life Bipasha Basu, who was seen in Raaz and Aatma, has experienced various paranormal experiences earlier. But after acting in Creature 3D, she will certainly think twice before doing another movie in the same genre. Bipasha had studied a lot about Brahmarakshas before doing ‘Creature 3D’. She started taking help of the pandit after she began to experience nightmares related to Brahmarakshas. A source close to the actress says, “Bipasha is getting ready to travel south to do a special puja (ritual prayers) to ward off the Brahmarakshas that is haunting her ever since acting in ‘Creature 3D’, in which the creature is a Brahmarakshas. (timesofindia.com) Side Effects of Stress Your traffic light just turned green, and you’re about to pull out into an intersection when you notice another car is barreling through and will hit you. Quick, hit the brakes! The car passes in front of you; the crash is averted. Your heart is racing. You’re holding your breath. Exhale. Your hands are gripping the steering wheel tightly, and your entire body has tensed in anticipation of the collision. Relax, you’re safe. In that split-second, near-miss accident, several systems in your body kicked into gear. One of those is a part of your brain called the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) system, which released a cascade of chemicals—such as adrenaline, steroid hormones, and cortisol—that kicked up your heart rate, helped your brain with that split-second decision, and increased glucose in the bloodstream to give you a burst of energy to react. You didn’t even have to tell it what to do. This is your body’s natural reaction to stress. But what is not natural is continuously facing stressful situations and challenges day after day. This is known as chronic stress and can be detrimental to your health. Forty-three percent of adults say they suffer adverse health effects from stress, and three-quarters of all doctor’s visits are the result of stress-related ailments and complaints. Stress is also linked to several serious diseases and unhealthy situations, such as heart disease, cancer, lung disease, accidents, cirrhosis of the liver, and suicide. It’s important to understand how stress can impact your day-to-day life as well as your long-term health. Here are some ways that chronic stress may affect your physical and mental health. Brain Stress can impede your thought processes and hamper your thinking. You may find making simple decisions like what to have for dinner or remembering directions to a restaurant are more difficult than in a nonstressed state. Emotions People dealing with chronic stress may be easily frustrated and quick to lose their temper. They may cry more often and spend considerably more time worrying about things than they would without being stressed. Teeth and Gums Strange as it may seem, stress can take a toll on your oral health. Stress may cause you to clench or grind your teeth. It’s often done unconsciouslyor during your sleep, but if it’s not treated, it may lead to problems with your temporomandibular joints. Stress may also lead to gum disease, perhaps because of teeth grinding, less attention to oral hygiene, salivary changes, and impaired immunity. Heart In terms of its effect on the body, stress is dangerous to your heart. Stress hormones speed up your heart rate, constrict blood vessels, and make the heart and blood vessels more likely to overreact in the event of a future stressful event. Stress is also linked to high blood pressure, blood clots, and in some cases, even stroke. Lungs People with asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) often have worsening symptoms during times of chronic stress. Stomach Stress may make your stomach uneasy, and you may have increased incidence of nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. In people with gastrointestinal disorders and diseases like gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), ulcerative colitis, and peptic ulcer disease, symptoms may be worsened by stress. Skin Stress may make skin problems such as psoriasis, eczema, acne, and rosacea worse. It is also known to bring on cold sores and fever blisters. Hair Your hair may fall victim to your stress. When a person is under a great deal of stress, his or her hair may enter the falling-out stage of the hair life cycle. It can occur up to three months after the stressful event, but hair usually grows back within a year. Muscles Stress-related tension in your back, neck, and shoulders can lead to muscle pain throughout your body. Immune System If it seems you always get sick when you can least afford it, it may be because your stress is suppressing your immune system, making you more susceptible to infection. Stress can worsen symptoms of chronic illness such as rheumatoid arthritis and diabetes. (healthline.com) What is fog? Fog is a condensed collection of water droplets and ice crystals near the Earth’s surface. Fog is differentiated from clouds through both its height – clouds being significantly higher in the atmosphere – and how moisture has been generated, with the former acquiring it from local, ground-based sources such as rivers, oceans and marshes. As a general fule, fog reduces visibility to less than one kilometres (0.6 miles), while mist or haze is anywhere over that distance. Typically, fog accumulates in low-lying areas of terrain such as valleys and plains, due to the increased moisture content and shelter from strong winds. (howitworksdaily.com) Elephants never forget human voices New research discovers that elephants can distinguish human ethnicity and gender by their voices. The African Elephant has always been under threat from human poachers desiring ivory and meat. However, recent study has shown that elephants are starting to distinguish between different types of human contact. Scientists from the University of Sussex played audio recordings of different humans to the mammals and found that they reacted differently depending on the voice. For instance, in Africa the Maasi people generally encounter elephants more than the Kamba people. When the sound of Maasi people was played, the herd moved into a defensive formation. When the sound of the Kamba people was played, there was a less provoked reaction. This shows that elephants can distinguish between humans that are threats and those that are not. Moreover, elephants reacted in a more hostile manner to male voices than female sounds. This make sense as in local tribes, males are traditionally the hunter gathers and come in contact with a parade more often. This study is the first of its kind and demonstrates the intelligence of elephants and will help in their continued conservation and protection.
